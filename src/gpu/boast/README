This directory contains source files necessary to genrate SPECFEM3D kernels in both cuda and OpenCL flavor.

using ruby you can regenerate the list of kernels. You might need to create an "output" directory in this folder during development.
so:

cd specfem3d_globe/src/gpu/boast/
mkfir output
ruby kernels.rb

will generate the kernels in the output directory.

if non regression data are installed in specfem3d_globe/src/gpu/kernels.test/ then you can test the kernels by
ruby kernels.rb -c
it will use the non regression testing data to give you information about the behavior of the kernels (accuracy and performance).
If tests are not installed it will just compile the kernels and check for compilation errors.

you might have to manually deactivate CUDA kernels test:

diff --git a/src/gpu/boast/kernels.rb b/src/gpu/boast/kernels.rb
index 4d2b31d..e4a678f 100644
--- a/src/gpu/boast/kernels.rb

If you want Intel vectorization report you can execute BOAST in verbose mode:
VERBOSE=true ruby kernels.rb -c
or use different CL flags:
CLFLAGS=-cl-fast-relaxed-math ruby kernels.rb -c
That should be the default in SPECFEM3D (even if for now if seems the default is no flags for OpenCL, which gives a certain advantage to CUDA).

If you have a problem of platform selection or want to restrict the test to 1 kernel:
ruby kernels.rb -c -k crust_mantle_impl_kernel_forward -p INTEL

Once you want to test your kernels in SPECFEM3D then you can
ruby kernels.rb -c -o ../kernels.gen/

At this point you may need to reactivate cuda support in order to have all the files correctly generated (never tested without cuda kernels being generated)
