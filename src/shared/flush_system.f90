  subroutine flush_IMAIN()

  use constants

  implicit none

  ! only main process writes out to main output file
  ! file I/O in Fortran is buffered by default
  !
  ! note: Fortran2003 includes a FLUSH statement
  !          which is implemented by most compilers by now
  !
  ! otherwise:
  !   a) comment out the line below
  !   b) try to use instead: call flush(IMAIN)

  flush(IMAIN)

  end subroutine flush_IMAIN

  subroutine system_command(command)

  use constants

  implicit none

  character(len=MAX_STRING_LEN), intent(in):: command

  ! note: system() is a GNU Fortran extension, compilers might complain about this command
  !       (non-standard Fortran2003)
  !
  ! otherwise:
  !   a) comment out the line below
  !   b) try to use other function implementation: e.g. Fortran 2008 supports
  !      call execute_command_line(trim(command))

  call system(trim(command))

  end subroutine system_command
