/* In all of the routines below:

   k = Number of data devices
   m = Number of coding devices
   w = Word size

   data_ptrs = An array of k pointers to data which is size bytes.
               Size must be a multiple of sizeof(long).
               Pointers must also be longword aligned.

   coding_ptrs = An array of m pointers to coding data which is size bytes.

   packetsize = The size of a coding block with bitmatrix coding.
                When you code with a bitmatrix, you will use w packets
                of size packetsize.

   matrix = an array of k*m integers.
            It represents an m by k matrix.
            Element i,j is in matrix[i*k+j];

   bitmatrix = an array of k*m*w*w integers.
            It represents an mw by kw matrix.
            Element i,j is in matrix[i*k*w+j];

   erasures = an array of id's of erased devices.
              Id's are integers between 0 and k+m-1.
              Id's 0 to k-1 are id's of data devices.
              Id's k to k+m-1 are id's of coding devices:
                  Coding device id = id-k.
              If there are e erasures, erasures[e] = -1.

   schedule = an array of schedule operations.

              If there are m operations, then schedule[m][0] = -1.

   operation = an array of 5 integers:

          0 = operation: 0 for copy, 1 for xor (-1 for end)
          1 = source device (0 - k+m-1)
          2 = source packet (0 - w-1)
          3 = destination device (0 - k+m-1)
          4 = destination packet (0 - w-1)

 - jerasure_matrix_to_bitmatrix turns a m X k matrix in GF(2^w) into a
                              wm X wk bitmatrix (in GF(2)).  This is
                              explained in the Cauchy Reed-Solomon coding
                              paper.

 - jerasure_dumb_bitmatrix_to_schedule turns a bitmatrix into a schedule
                              using the straightforward algorithm -- just
                              schedule the dot products defined by each
                              row of the matrix.

 - jerasure_smart_bitmatrix_to_schedule turns a bitmatrix into a schedule,
                              but tries to use previous dot products to
                              calculate new ones.  This is the optimization
                              explained in the original Liberation code paper.

 - jerasure_generate_schedule_cache precalcalculate all the schedule for the
                              given distribution bitmatrix.  M must equal 2.

 - jerasure_free_schedule frees a schedule that was allocated with
                              jerasure_XXX_bitmatrix_to_schedule.

 - jerasure_free_schedule_cache frees a schedule cache that was created with
                              jerasure_generate_schedule_cache.

   The parameter row_k_ones should be set to 1 if row k of the matrix
   (or rows kw to (k+1)w+1) of th distribution matrix are all ones
   (or all identity matrices).  Then you can improve the performance
   of decoding when there is more than one failure, and the parity
   device didn't fail.  You do it by decoding all but one of the data
   devices, and then decoding the last data device from the data devices
   and the parity device.

   jerasure_schedule_decode_lazy generates the schedule on the fly.

   jerasure_matrix_decode only works when w = 8|16|32.

   jerasure_make_decoding_matrix/bitmatrix make the k*k decoding matrix
         (or wk*wk bitmatrix) by taking the rows corresponding to k
         non-erased devices of the distribution matrix, and then
         inverting that matrix.

         You should already have allocated the decoding matrix and
         dm_ids, which is a vector of k integers.  These will be
         filled in appropriately.  dm_ids[i] is the id of element
         i of the survivors vector.  I.e. row i of the decoding matrix
         times dm_ids equals data drive i.

         Both of these routines take "erased" instead of "erasures".
         Erased is a vector with k+m elements, which has 0 or 1 for
         each device's id, according to whether the device is erased.

   jerasure_erasures_to_erased allocates and returns erased from erasures.

   They are more efficient than the inverstion functions.

   Mat will be destroyed when the matrix inversion or invertible
   testing is done.  Sorry.

   Inv must be allocated by the caller.

   matrix is uninvertible.

   The two invertible function simply return whether the matrix is
