======================>   COMPILE AND INSTALL FTI   <======================


 * See the INSTALL file


======================>   CONFIGURE FTI FOR YOUR JOB   <======================


 * Place yourself in the examples directory
    - cd examples

 * Open the FTI configuration file with your favorite text editor
    - vi config.fti

 * Set the three directory variables in the FTI configuration file
    - Ckpt_dir = /path/to/local/storage (Storage LOCAL to the compute nodes)
    - Glbl_dir = /path/to/global/storage (Storage accessible to ALL nodes)
    - Meta_dir = /home/username/.fti (Storage accessible to ALL nodes)

 * OPTION: If you want to run the tests in local in one single node,
   declare 'localhost' as the only host in the Hostfile and set
   the Local_test option to 1 in the FTI configuration file.
    - Local_test: 1


======================>   RUN YOUR FTI TEST JOB   <======================


 * Update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your .bashrc script.
    - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(FTIPATH)/FTI/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

 * You might need to 'source' your .bashrc in your current terminal
    - source ~/.bashrc

 * INFO : This test runs 8 MPI processes in 4 nodes (2 processes per node).
 It runs 4 application proc. and 4 FTI proc. (1 of each per node). The test
 execute 1500 iterations and checkpoints.

 * Set the FTIPATH in the Makefile
    WARNING: It should be equal to the install path FTIPATH followed by '/FTI'

 * Compile the dummy test program
    - make

 * If you need to set a Hostfile to run your MPI job, set FOUR nodes.
    WARNING: If you declare more nodes in your Hostfile, MPI might place
    some MPI processes in the other nodes, making the configuration given
    in the config.fti file wrong. If you declare less nodes in the hostfile
    then your job will have more MPI ranks per node.

 * Launch the test that uses the edited configuration file
    - make test


======================>   OTHERS   <======================


 * FTI requires you to run the same number of processes in every node
 otherwise FTI will exit with error at the initialization.

 * FTI requires you to run on a number of nodes multiple of the Group_size
 defined in the FTI configuration file.

 * FTI assumes that every node has local storage with enough space to store
 one or two checkpoint files plus encodings.
