# Specfem3D Globe

Program specfem3D from `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE` is a 3-D spectral-element solver for the Earth.
It uses a mesh generated by program meshfem3D.

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE was founded by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp, and is now being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive community. A complete list of authors can be found at
