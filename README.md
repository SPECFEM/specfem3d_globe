# Specfem3D Globe

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/17524829.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7756943)

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE simulates global and regional (continental-scale) seismic wave propagation.
The program `xspecfem3D` from SPECFEM3D_GLOBE is a 3-D spectral-element solver for the Earth, Moon or Mars.
It uses a conforming cubed-sphere mesh of hexahedra generated by program `xmeshfem3D`.

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE was founded by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp, and is now being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive community. A complete list of authors can be found at

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE are available
in the 

- PDF manual located in directory: [doc/USER_MANUAL](doc/USER_MANUAL).

- HTML manual (latest version): [specfem3d-globe.readthedocs.io](http://specfem3d-globe.readthedocs.io/)


For a quick test, run the default example with these commands:
```
./configure FC=gfortran CC=gcc MPIFC=mpif90
make all
cd EXAMPLES/regional_Greece_small/
./run_this_example.sh
```
and check the output files in `./OUTPUT_FILES/`

>__NOTE__: Do not modify the 'configure' script directly. Please modify the
    'configure.ac' file instead, and generate a new 'configure' script with
    the command: `autoreconf -i`

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive and
participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating! We have collected a set of guidelines and advice on how to get
involved in the community and keep them in the specfem3d github wiki:
