# MESH INFORMATION
# ================
# int NPROCTOT_VAL: Total number of MPI processes (check OUTPUT_FILES/values_from_mesher.h)
# int NSPEC2D_TOP_CM: Number of elements per process in the region 1 of the mesh (check OUTPUT_FILES/values_from_mesher.h)
# str INDIR: Path to directory containing mask_noise.bin.
# str OUTDIR: Path to write output files.
# int NGLLX: Number of GLL points on the X direction. By default, keep this at 5.
# int NGLLY: Number of GLL points on the Y direction. By default, keep this at 5.

# NOISE DIRECTION
# ===============
# float <X,Y,Z>DIR: Components of a unit vector indicating the noise direction.
XDIR: 0.0
YDIR: 0.0
ZDIR: 1.0

# NOISE DISTRIBUTIONS
# ===================
# list DISTRIBUTIONS: List containing dictionaries that define noise distributions (uniform, ocean, gaussian).
# Each distribution is added to form one final distribution. Modify at your convenience.
#
# Available distributions:
# uniform: Uniform noise source.
# ocean:  Noise source only at the ocean.
# gaussian: 2D gaussian anomaly.
