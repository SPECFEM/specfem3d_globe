This is a regional example for running simultaneous runs as one "big" simulation. 
It uses the setting in Par_file:

  NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS =  4

to run 4 different earthquakes on the same mesh as one "big" forward simulation.
This example is similar to the regional_Greece_small/ example, but uses additional CMTSOLUTIONS.

Seismogram files can be found in the run-directories run0001/ etc.


1. forward simulation:
----------------------

type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding
script "run_mesher_solver.bash".

Reference seismograms for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/
Please modify the setup and scripts according to your specifics.
