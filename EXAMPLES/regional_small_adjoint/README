This example creates a regional mesh using 1D model AK135 
and runs a "purely" adjoint simulation (SIMULATION_TYPE == 2).
It back-projects the seismic wavefield recorded at stations in file DATA/STATIONS_ADJOINT.

The simulation is setup to use 4 CPUs only, thus can be run locally on a desktop machine
(needs to have MPI installed).


running adjoint simulation:
---------------------------

type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding
script "run_mesher_solver.bash".

The simulation is accurate down to a shortest period of ~ 45 s.
(minimum period resolved ~ (256/NEX_XI) * (ANGULAR_WIDTH_XI_IN_DEGREES/90) * 17)
 
Reference output for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/

Please modify these scripts according to your specifics.
