This example creates a regional, local mesh with a cut-off depth at 200 km.
It uses an IRIS EMC model for Alaska, embedded into the isotropic PREM background model.

The simulation is setup to use 4 CPUs only, thus can be run locally on a desktop machine
(needs to have MPI installed).

0. model setup:
---------------

Please check out the README.md file in the DATA/IRIS_EMC/ folder.

This example is supposed to run with the Alaska EMC model:
* Alaska.JointInversion-RF+Vph+HV-1.Berg.2020-nc4.nc
  https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-alaskajointinversion_rfvphhv-1berg2020/

You will need to download the model file and rename it (or create a symbolic link), to be found as "DATA/IRIS_EMC/model.nc".


1. forward simulation:
----------------------

Make sure you compile the code with NetCDF support. This can be done by configuring with flag `--with-emc` or `--with-netcdf` and 
corresponding flags (see configure --help).
For example:
./configure --with-netcdf NETCDF_INC=/opt/local/include NETCDF_LIBS="-L/opt/local/lib -lnetcdff"


To run the simulation, type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding script "run_mesher_solver.bash".
Reference seismograms for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/

Please modify these scripts according to your specifics.
