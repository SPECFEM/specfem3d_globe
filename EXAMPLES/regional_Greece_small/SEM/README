This directory contains a travel-time adjoint source for 
station: 

BEKI - Bekirli, North Anatolian Fault Passive Seismic Experiment (http://www.iris.edu/mda/YL/BEKI?timewindow=2005-2008)


The adjoint source files were created by:
  > ./create_adjoint_source.sh


The time window is taken from 130 to 147.5 s. According to phtimes, it includes:
  Pn         138.60
  
note: the adjoint stations file STATIONS_ADJOINT must be copied over into directory DATA/
      for the setup of the kernel simulation. the script "run_this_example.kernel.sh" does this for you.

      Keep in mind that these adjoint source files are setup specifically for this
      default example and must match the duration length of the forward simulation. 
      Changing the simulation length would require to recalculate these files.
