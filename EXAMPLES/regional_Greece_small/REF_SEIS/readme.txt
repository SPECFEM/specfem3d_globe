Reference seismograms are provided here for validation.

This reference simulation was done on a Cray XC30 system, "Piz Daint" provided by the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS).
Compute nodes are equipped with an 8-core 64-bit Intel SandyBridge CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2670), an NVIDIA Tesla K20X with 6 GB GDDR5 memory,
and 32 GB of host memory.

The simulation setup uses: 1 node, 4 MPI-processes per node
