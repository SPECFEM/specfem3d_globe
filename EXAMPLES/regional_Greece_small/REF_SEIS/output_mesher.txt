 ----- creating chunk buffers -----

 There are            2  slices along xi in each chunk
 There are            2  slices along eta in each chunk
 There is a total of            4  slices in each chunk
 There are            1  chunks
 There is a total of            4  slices in all the chunks

 There is a total of            2  messages to assemble faces between chunks
