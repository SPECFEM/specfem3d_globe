 There are            2  slices along xi in each chunk
 There are            2  slices along eta in each chunk
 There is a total of            4  slices in each chunk
 There are            1  chunks
 There is a total of            4  slices in all the chunks

 There is a total of            2  messages to assemble faces between chunks


 only one chunk, no need to create chunk buffers


   ...preparing MPI interfaces

 inner core region:
   #max of points in MPI buffers along xi npoin2D_xi =          169
   #max of array elements transferred npoin2D_xi*NDIM =          507

   #max of points in MPI buffers along eta npoin2D_eta =          169
   #max of array elements transferred npoin2D_eta*NDIM =          507

 inner core MPI:
   maximum interfaces:           3
   MPI addressing maximum interfaces:           3
   MPI addressing : all interfaces okay

 Load balancing = 100 % by definition


 the time step of the solver will be DT =   0.165000007

 using single precision for the calculations

 smallest and largest possible floating-point numbers are:    1.17549435E-38   3.40282347E+38
