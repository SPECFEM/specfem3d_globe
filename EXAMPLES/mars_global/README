Example of a global simulation for Mars

Simulation uses a 3D Mars model (defined in DATA/mars/SH_model/) together with topography and a 3D crustal model.
The setup runs on 6 CPU cores (MPI processes), with a runtime of about 10 min.

The station used is the very broadband seismometer ELYSE placed by the InSight mission lander.
The source is a CMT solution for marsquake event S0235b.

1. forward simulation:
----------------------

type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding
script "run_mesher_solver.bash".

Reference seismograms for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/
Please modify the setup and scripts according to your specifics.
