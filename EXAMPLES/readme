Benchmark normal-mode (obani-qmxd) vs. sem
------------------------------------------

Each directory corresponds to an experiement
normal-mode vs. sem which is hopefully sufficiently defined 
by the directory's name 

The standard contents of each directory are the following:
QMXD/	*.qmxd.bz2 : ascii unprocessed qmxd-seismograms 
	 DATA/ : cmt and stations files 
		and command line launching the qmxd script 
		(available in /opt/seismo-util/bin)  

SEMD/ 	*.semd.ascii.bz2 : ascii unprocessed sem-seismograms
	DATA/ : cmt, stations and parameter files

processing : processing script 
	    (convolve, filter, write sac file and rotate)	 
	    needs process_synt.pl and rotate.pl
	    (in SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_V4.0/UTILS/)

CMTSOLUTION : input file for processing
STATIONS    : input files for processing  

Computing Benchmarks:
To compute synthetics which match with those in each directory, use
the CMTSOLUTION and STATIONS files located at
	prem_*/SEMD/DATA/CMTSOLUTION
	prem_*/SEMD/DATA/STATIONS
The SEMD/DATA/CMTSOLUTION has the "half duration" set to 0.0 seconds as opposed to 
the CMTSOLUTION in each base directory (prem_*/CMTSOLUTION) which has 
the "half duration" set to a value used in post processing to agree 
with the filtering.

Post Processing Concerns for Small Epicentral Distances or Long Records:
Post processing scripts such as ./process_syn.pl use a taper before filtering to
reduce artifacts due to possible steps occurring at the beginning and end of 
seismograms.  This taper, implemented in the program SAC, determines the taper width
based on the length of the record, defaulting to 5% of the beginning and end of 
the record.  For records with small epicentral distances the arrivals are near the 
beginning of the seismogram and have a good possibility of being reduced in amplitude
as a result of the filter.  This may result in a mismatch between the SEMD synthetics 
and those computed in another fashion (QMXD).
