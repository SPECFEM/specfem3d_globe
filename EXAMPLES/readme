         SEM V3.6 EXAMPLE RUNS

###########################################

  This directory contains example SEM runs at two resolutions (NEX=240, 480), 
for transversely anisotropic prem with *ONE LAYER* crust (i.e., 
velocities from 0 to 24.4 km are vp=5.8km/s vs=3.2km/s).  
NEX240 runs are accurate down to ~25 s. NEX480 runs are accurate down to ~12 s. 

  Seismograms in this directory have been verified to be identical to those generated
using SEM V3.5. In NEX_240/Q and NEX_480/Q directories, PREM attenuation 
is incorporated, in NEX_240/no_Q and NEX_480/no_Q directories, attenuation is ignored. 

  Input parameters, CMT and STATION files can be found under subdirectories DATA/
