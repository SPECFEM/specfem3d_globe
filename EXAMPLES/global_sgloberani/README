Example of a global simulation using model SGLOBE-rani (Chang et al., 2015):

SGLOBE-rani: a global radially anisotropic shear wave speed model with radial anisotropy allowed in the whole mantle. 
             It is based on a seismic data set of over 43M seismic surface wave (fundamental and overtones) and body wave measurements. 
             It models simultaneously crustal thickness and mantle structure, and its reference model is PREM. 
 
Simulation uses the smallest possible global mesh without topograpy, i.e. a mesh with NEX=32, for testing.
The setup runs on 6 CPU cores (MPI processes), with a runtime of about 8 min.

The source model is a finite fault CMTSOLUTION for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake provided by USGS:

To run a forward simulation, type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding
script "run_mesher_solver.bash".

The simulation is accurate down to a shortest period of ~ 136 s.
(minimum period resolved ~ (256/NEX_XI) * 17 = (256/32) * 17 ~ 136 s)

Reference seismograms for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/
Please modify the setup and scripts according to your specifics.
