Examples of sensitivity kernel calculations for
- cross-correlation traveltime kernels and
- amplitude kernels.

The simulations are for a single source-receiver pair
under the directories traveltime/ and amplitude/, respectively.


Both examples make use of filtered adjoint sources. The basic steps involve:

1. run a forward simulation:

   use the scripts ./run_this_example.sh to run a single forward simulation and create synthetic
   seismograms in the OUTPUT_FILES/ directory.

   You can compare the solutions obtained with the reference seismograms provided in
   directory REF_SEIS/.


2. create adjoint sources:

   use the scripts SEM/create_adjoint_sources.sh to create filtered adjoint sources.

   Filtering adjoint sources involves filtering twice:
   - first, filter the synthetics before constructing the adjoint sources, then
   - second, filter the adjoint sources again.
   This leads to correctly computed adjoint sensitivity kernels for a band-passed
   traveltime or amplitude measurement within a specified time window.

3. run a kernel simulation:

   use the scripts ./run_this_example.kernel.sh to run a kernel simulation and create the corresponding
   sensitivity kernels in the DATABASES_MPI/ directory.

   Visualizations of kernels with Paraview involve creating VTK-files, using the script ./xcombine_vol_data.sh.


Note: The example simulations here make use of simplified physics and coarse resolutions for faster calculations, 
      e.g. we compute sensitivity kernels without taking topography, gravity, rotation, or attenuation into account.

      For more realistic computations, please consider turning on the corresponding options in your Par_file following the user manual.
