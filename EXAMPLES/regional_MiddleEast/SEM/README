This directory contains a travel-time adjoint source for 
station: 

GAR - Garm, Tajikistan (http://ida.ucsd.edu/public/II/GAR/gar.html)


The adjoint source files were created by:
  > ./create_adjoint_source.sh


The time window is taken from 190 to 225 s. According to phtimes, it includes:
 Pn         198.73
 pPn        201.82
 sPn        203.74
 P          206.55
 PnPn       206.64

  
note: the adjoint stations file STATIONS_ADJOINT must be copied over into directory DATA/
      for the setup of the kernel simulation. the script "run_this_example.kernel.sh" does this for you.

      Keep in mind that these adjoint source files are setup specifically for this
      default example and must match the duration length of the forward simulation. 
      Changing the simulation length would require to recalculate these files.
