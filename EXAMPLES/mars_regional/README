Example of a regional simulation for Mars

Simulation uses a 1D Mars model (Sohl & Spohn, 1997) together with topography and a 3D crustal model.
The setup runs on 4 CPU cores (MPI processes), with a runtime of about 1 min.

The station used is the very broadband seismometer ELYSE placed by the InSight mission lander.


1. forward simulation:
----------------------

type:
./run_this_example.sh

to setup this directory for the simulation and to run a corresponding
script "run_mesher_solver.bash".

The simulation is accurate down to a shortest period of ~ 6 s.
(minimum period resolved ~ (256/NEX_XI) * (ANGULAR_WIDTH/90) * 5 = (256/32) * (15/90) * 5 ~ 6.6 s)
 
Reference seismograms for comparisons are provided in the directory: REF_SEIS/
Please modify the setup and scripts according to your specifics.
