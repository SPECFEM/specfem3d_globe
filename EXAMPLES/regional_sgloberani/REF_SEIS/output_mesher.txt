 the time step of the solver will be DT =   0.115000002

 using single precision for the calculations

 smallest and largest possible floating-point numbers are:    1.17549435E-38   3.40282347E+38


 Elapsed time for mesh generation and buffer creation in seconds =    41.1570396
 Elapsed time for mesh generation and buffer creation in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 41 s

 End of mesh generation
