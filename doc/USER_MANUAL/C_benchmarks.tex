\chapter{Benchmarks}

\citet{KoTr02a,KoTr02b} carefully benchmarked the spectral-element
simulations of global seismic waves against normal-mode seismograms.
Version 4.0 of \texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE} has been benchmarked again
following the same procedure.\newline


In this appendix we present two tests: a `long-period' (periods longer
than 17~s) simulation of a shallow event in isotropic PREM \citep{DzAn81}
without the ocean layer, without attenuation but including the effects
of self-gravitation (in the Cowling approximation) (Figures \ref{fig:Vanuatu-with-Vertical}
and \ref{fig:Vanuatu-with-Transverse}), and a `short-period' (periods
longer than 9~s) simulation of a deep event in transversely isotropic
PREM without the ocean layer and including the effects of self-gravitation
and attenuation (Figures \ref{fig:Bolivia-with-Vertical}, \ref{fig:Bolivia-with-Transverse}
and \ref{fig:Bolivia-PKP}).

The normal-mode synthetics are calculated with the code \texttt{QmXD}
using mode catalogs with a shortest period of 8~s generated by the
code \texttt{OBANI}. No free-air, tilt, or gravitational potential
corrections were applied \citep{DaTr98}. We also turned off the effect
of the oceans in \texttt{QmXD}.\newline


The normal-mode and SEM displacement seismograms are first calculated
for a step source-time function, i.e., setting the parameter \texttt{half}
\texttt{duration} in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file to zero for the
SEM simulations. Both sets of seismograms are subsequently convolved
with a triangular source-time function using the processing script \newline
\texttt{utils/seis\_process/process\_syn.pl}. They are also band-pass filtered
and the horizontal components are rotated to the radial and transverse
directions (with the script \texttt{utils/seis\_process/rotate.pl}).\newline


The match between the normal-mode and SEM seismograms is quite remarkable
for the experiment with attenuation, considering the very different
implementations of attenuation in the two computations (e.g., frequency
domain versus time domain, constant Q versus absorption bands).\newline


Further tests can be found in the \texttt{EXAMPLES} directory. It
contains the normal-mode and SEM seismograms, and the parameters (\texttt{STATIONS},
\texttt{CMTSOLUTION} and \texttt{Par\_file}) for the SEM simulations.\newline


Important remark: when comparing SEM results to normal mode results, one needs to
convert source and receiver coordinates from geographic to geocentric coordinates,
because on the equator the geographic and
geocentric latitude are identical but not elsewhere. Even for
spherically-symmetric simulations one must perform this conversion
because the source and receiver locations provided by www.globalCMT.org and
IRIS involve geographic coordinates.
