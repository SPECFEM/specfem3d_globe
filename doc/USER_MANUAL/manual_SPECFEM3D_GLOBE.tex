The SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE package was first developed by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jean-Pierre Vilotte at Institut de Physique du Globe (IPGP) in Paris, France
from 1995 to 1997 and then by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp at Harvard University and Caltech, USA, starting in 1998.
The story started on March 28, 1995, when Prof. Yvon Maday from CNRS and University of Paris, France, gave a lecture to
Dimitri Komatitsch and Jean-Pierre Vilotte at IPG about the nice properties of the spectral-element method that he had used for
other equations. We are deeply indebted and thankful to him for that.

\chapter{Introduction}

The software package SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE simulates three-dimensional
global and regional seismic wave propagation based upon the spectral-element method (SEM).
The SEM is a continuous Galerkin technique \citep{TrKoLi08,PeKoLuMaLeCaLeMaLiBlNiBaTr11},
which can easily be made discontinous \citep{BeMaPa94,Ch00,KoWoHu02,ChCaVi03,LaWaBe05,Kop06,WiStBuGh10,AcKo11};
it is then close to a particular case of the discontinuous Galerkin technique \citep{ReHi73,LeRa74,Arn82,JoPi86,BoMaHe91,FaRi99,HuHuRa99,CoKaSh00,GiHeWa02,RiWh03,MoRi05,GrScSc06,AiMoMu06,BeLaPi06,DuKa06,DeSeWh08,PuAmKa09,WiStBuGh10,DeSe10,EtChViGl10}, with optimized efficiency because of its tensorized basis functions \citep{WiStBuGh10,AcKo11}.
In particular, it can accurately handle very distorted mesh elements \citep{OlSe11}.\\

It has very good accuracy and convergence properties \citep{MaPa89,SePr94,DeFiMu02,Coh02,DeSe07,SeOl08,AiWa09,AiWa10,MeStTh12}.
The spectral element approach admits spectral rates of convergence and allows exploiting $hp$-convergence schemes.
It is also very well suited to parallel implementation on very large supercomputers \citep{KoTsChTr03,TsKoChTr03,KoLaMi08a,CaKoLaTiMiLeSnTr08,KoViCh10} as well as on clusters of GPU accelerating graphics cards \citep{KoMiEr09,KoErGoMi10,Kom11}. Tensor products inside each element can be optimized to reach very high efficiency \citep{DeFiMu02}, and mesh point and element numbering can be optimized to reduce processor cache misses and improve cache reuse \citep{KoLaMi08a}. The SEM can also handle triangular (in 2D) or tetrahedral (in 3D) elements \citep{WinBoyd96,TaWi00,KoMaTrTaWi01,Coh02,MeViSa06} as well as mixed meshes, although with increased cost and reduced accuracy in these elements, as in the discontinuous Galerkin method.\\

Note that in many geological models in the context of seismic wave propagation studies
(except for instance for fault dynamic rupture studies, in which very high frequencies or supershear rupture need to be modeled near the fault, see e.g. \cite{BeGlCrViPi07,BeGlCrVi09,PuAmKa09,TaCrEtViBeSa10})
a continuous formulation is sufficient because material property contrasts are not drastic and thus
conforming mesh doubling bricks can efficiently handle mesh size variations \citep{KoTr02a,KoLiTrSuStSh04,LeChLiKoHuTr08,LeChKoHuTr09,LeKoHuTr09}.
This is particularly true at the scale of the full Earth.\\

For a detailed introduction to the SEM as applied to
global and regional seismic wave propagation, please consult \citet{TrKoLi08,PeKoLuMaLeCaLeMaLiBlNiBaTr11,KoVi98,KoTr99,Ch00,KoTr02a,KoTr02b,KoRiTr02,ChCaVi03,CaChViMo03,ChVa04,ChKoViCaVaFe07}.
A detailed theoretical analysis of the dispersion
and stability properties of the SEM is available in \citet{Coh02}, \citet{DeSe07}, \citet{SeOl07}, \citet{SeOl08} and \citet{MeStTh12}.\\

Effects due to lateral variations in compressional-wave
speed, shear-wave speed, density, a 3D crustal model, ellipticity,
topography and bathymetry, the oceans, rotation, and self-gravitation are included.
The package can accommodate full 21-parameter anisotropy \citep{ChTr07}
as well as lateral variations in attenuation \citep{SaKoTr10}. Adjoint
capabilities and finite-frequency kernel simulations are also included
\citep{TrKoLi08,PeKoLuMaLeCaLeMaLiBlNiBaTr11,LiTr06,LiTr08,FiIgBuKe09,ViOp09}.\\

The SEM was originally developed in computational fluid dynamics \citep{Pat84,MaPa89}
and has been successfully adapted to address problems in seismic wave propagation.
Early seismic wave propagation applications of the SEM, utilizing Legendre basis functions and a
perfectly diagonal mass matrix, include \cite{CoJoTo93}, \cite{Kom97},
\cite{FaMaPaQu97}, \cite{CaGa97}, \cite{KoVi98} and \cite{KoTr99},
whereas applications involving Chebyshev basis functions and a nondiagonal mass matrix
include \cite{SePr94}, \cite{PrCaSe94} and \cite{SePrPr95}.\\

All SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE software is written in Fortran2003 with full portability
in mind, and conforms strictly to the Fortran2003 standard. It uses
no obsolete or obsolescent features of Fortran. The package uses
parallel programming based upon the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
\citep{GrLuSk94,Pac97}.\\

SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE won the Gordon Bell award for best performance at the SuperComputing~2003
conference in Phoenix, Arizona (USA) (see \cite{KoTsChTr03}
and \url{www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/nr_finalaward.html}).
It was a finalist again in 2008 for a run at 0.16 petaflops (sustained) on 149,784 processors of the `Jaguar' Cray XT5 system at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (USA) \citep{CaKoLaTiMiLeSnTr08}.
It also won the BULL Joseph Fourier supercomputing award in 2010.\\

The next release of the code will include support for GPU graphics card acceleration \citep{KoMiEr09,KoErGoMi10,MiKo10,Kom11}
as well as Convolutional or Auxiliary Differential Equation Perfectly Matched absorbing Layers (C-PML or ADE-PML)
\citep{MaKoEz08,MaKoGe08,MaKo09,MaKoGeBr10,KoMa07} for the case of single-chunk simulations in regional models.

\chapter{\label{cha:Getting-Started}Getting Started}

\section{Configuring and compiling the source code}

The SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE software package comes in a gzipped tar ball.
In the directory in which you want to install the package, type

\begin{lyxcode}
tar~-zxvf~SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE\_V5.1.5.tar.gz
\end{lyxcode}
The directory \texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE\_V5.1.5} will then contain
the source code.\\

We recommend that you add {\texttt{ulimit -S -s unlimited}} to your {\texttt{.bash\_profile}} file and/or {\texttt{limit stacksize unlimited }} to your {\texttt{.cshrc}} file to suppress any potential limit to the size of the Unix stack.\\

Then, to configure the software for your system, run the \texttt{configure}
shell script. This script will attempt to guess the appropriate configuration
values for your system. However, at a minimum, it is recommended that
you explicitly specify the appropriate command names for your Fortran
compiler and MPI package (another option is to define FC, CC and MPIF90 in your .bash\_profile
or your .cshrc file):

\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~FC=ifort~MPIFC=mpif90
\end{lyxcode}

Before running the \texttt{configure} script, you should probably edit file \texttt{flags.guess} to make sure that it contains the best compiler options for your system. Known issues or things to check are:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{Intel ifort compiler}}] See if you need to add \texttt{-assume byterecl} for your machine.
\item [{\texttt{IBM compiler}}] See if you need to add \texttt{-qsave} or \texttt{-qnosave} for your machine.
\item [{\texttt{Mac OS}}] You will probably need to install \texttt{XCODE}.
\end{description}

When compiling on an IBM machine with the \texttt{xlf} and \texttt{xlc} compilers, we suggest running the \texttt{configure} script
with the following options:\\

\noindent\texttt{./configure FC=xlf90\_r MPIFC=mpif90 CC=xlc\_r CFLAGS="-O3 -q64" FCFLAGS="-O3 -q64"}.\\

On SGI systems, \texttt{flags.guess} automatically informs \texttt{configure}
to insert ``\texttt{TRAP\_FPE=OFF}'' into the generated \texttt{Makefile}
in order to turn underflow trapping off.\\

Some do-loops have been modified using a common technique to help compilers enhance pipelining and make better use
of the cache. If you want to use these hand-optimized loops, add an additional flag ``\texttt{-D\_HANDOPT}'' to your compiler options
(with the IBM xlf compiler, change this to ``\texttt{-WF,-D\_HANDOPT}'').
BEWARE: we have observed that using \_HANDOPT in combination with -O3 or higher can lead to problems on some machines;
Thus, use this option only if you know what you are doing.
At the very least, run the same test simulation once with \_HANDOPT and once without
and make sure that all the seismograms you get (after convolution with a source time function, otherwise the raw seismograms before
convolution are too sensitive to roundoff noise) are the same down to roundoff noise.
You can do this for instance with the example given in EXAMPLES/small\_benchmark\_run\_to\_test\_a\_new\_machine.\\

If you run very large meshes on a relatively small number
of processors, the memory size needed on each processor might become
greater than 2 gigabytes, which is the upper limit for 32-bit addressing.
In this case, on some compilers you may need to add \texttt{``-mcmodel=medium}'' or \texttt{``-mcmodel=medium -shared-intel}''
to the configure options of CFLAGS, FCFLAGS and LDFLAGS otherwise the compiler will display an error
message (for instance \texttt{``relocation truncated to fit: R\_X86\_64\_PC32 against .bss''} or something similar);
on an IBM machine with the \texttt{xlf} and \texttt{xlc} compilers, using \texttt{-q64} is usually sufficient.\\

A summary of the most important configuration variables follows.

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{FC}}] Fortran compiler command name. By default, \texttt{configure}
will execute the command names of various well-known Fortran compilers
in succession, picking the first one it finds that works.
\item [{\texttt{MPIFC}}] MPI Fortran command name. The default is \texttt{mpif90}.
This must correspond to the same underlying compiler specified by
\texttt{FC}; otherwise, you will encounter compilation or link errors
when you attempt to build the code. If you are unsure about this,
it is usually safe to set both \texttt{FC} and \texttt{MPIFC} to the
MPI compiler command for your system:
\end{description}
\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~FC=mpif90~MPIFC=mpif90
\end{lyxcode}
\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{FLAGS\_CHECK}}] Compiler flags.
\item [{\texttt{LOCAL\_PATH\_IS\_ALSO\_GLOBAL}}]
If you want the parallel mesher to write a parallel (i.e., split) database for the solver on the
local disks of each of the compute nodes, set this flag to \texttt{.false.}.
Some systems have no local disks
(e.g., BlueGene) and other systems have a fast
parallel file system (LUSTRE, GPFS) that is easy and reliable to use, in which case this variable should be set to
\texttt{.true.}. Note that this flag is not used by the mesher nor
the solver; it is only used for some of the (optional) post-processing.
If you do not know what is best on your system, setting it to \texttt{.true.} is usually fine; or else, ask your system administrator.
\end{description}
In addition to reading configuration variables, \texttt{configure}
accepts the following options:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{-{}-enable-double-precision}}] The package can run either
in single or in double precision mode. The default is single precision
because for almost all calculations performed using the spectral-element method
using single precision is sufficient and gives the same results (i.e. the same seismograms);
and the single precision code is faster and requires exactly half as much memory. To specify
double precision mode, simply provide \texttt{-{}-enable-double-precision}
as a command-line argument to \texttt{configure}.
On many current processors (e.g., Intel, AMD, IBM Power), single precision calculations
are significantly faster; the difference can typically be 10\%
to 25\%. It is therefore better to use single precision.
What you can do once for the physical problem you want to study is run the same calculation in single precision
and in double precision on your system and compare the seismograms.
If they are identical (and in most cases they will), you can select single precision for your future runs.
\item [{\texttt{-{}-help}}] Directs \texttt{configure} to print a usage
screen which provides a short description of all configuration variables
and options. Note that the options relating to installation directories
(e.g., \texttt{-{}-prefix}) do not apply to SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE.
\end{description}
The \texttt{configure} script runs a brief series of checks. Upon
successful completion, it generates the files \texttt{Makefile}, \texttt{constants.h},
and \texttt{precision.h} in the working directory.

\begin{description}
\item [{Note:}] If the \texttt{configure} script fails, and you don't know
what went wrong, examine the log file \texttt{config.log}. This file
contains a detailed transcript of all the checks \texttt{configure}
performed. Most importantly, it includes the error output (if any)
from your compiler.
\end{description}
The \texttt{configure} script automatically runs the script \texttt{flags.guess}.
This helper script contains a number of suggested flags for various
compilers; e.g., Portland, Intel, Absoft, NAG, Lahey, NEC, IBM and
SGI. The software has run on a wide variety of compute platforms,
e.g., various PC clusters and machines from Sun, SGI, IBM, Compaq,
and NEC. The \texttt{flags.guess} script attempts to guess which compiler
you are using (based upon the compiler command name) and choose the
related optimization flags. The \texttt{configure} script then automatically
inserts the suggested flags into \texttt{Makefile}. Note that \texttt{flags.guess}
may fail to identify your compiler; and in any event, the default
flags chosen by \texttt{flags.guess} are undoubtedly not optimal for
your system. So, we encourage you to experiment with these flags (by
editing the generated \texttt{Makefile} by hand) and to solicit advice
from your system administrator. Selecting the right compiler and compiler
flags can make a tremendous difference in terms of performance. We
welcome feedback on your experience with various compilers and flags.\\

When using a slow or not too powerful shared disk system or when running extremely large simulations
(on tens of thousands of processor cores), one can add \texttt{-DUSE\_SERIAL\_CASCADE\_FOR\_IOs} to the compiler flags
in file \texttt{flags.guess} before running \texttt{configure} to make the mesher output mesh data
to the disk for one MPI slice after the other, and to make the solver do the same thing when reading the files back from disk.
Do not use this option if you do not need it because it will slow down the mesher and the beginning of the solver if your
shared file system is fast and reliable.

If you run scaling benchmarks of the code, for instance to measure its performance on a new machine, and are not interested in the physical results
(the seismograms) for these runs, you can set \texttt{DO\_BENCHMARK\_RUN\_ONLY} to \texttt{.true.} in file \texttt{setup/constants.h.in} before running the \texttt{configure} script.

Finally, before compiling, make sure that the subdirectories \texttt{obj},
\texttt{bak} and \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} exist within the directory
with the source code (\texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE\_V5.1.5}). The \texttt{go\_mesher}
script discussed below automatically takes care of creating the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory.

If your compiler has problems with the \texttt{use mpi} statements that are used in the code, use the script called
\texttt{replace\_use\_mpi\_with\_include\_mpif\_dot\_h.pl} in the root directory to replace all of them with \texttt{include 'mpif.h'} automatically.

We recommend that you ask for exclusive use of the compute nodes when running on a cluster or a supercomputer, i.e., make sure that no other users
are running on the same nodes at the same time. Otherwise your run could run out of memory if the memory of some nodes is used by other users, in particular
when undoing attenuation using the UNDO\_ATTENUATION option in DATA/Par\_file.
To do so, ask your system administrator for the option to add to your batch submission script; it is for instance 
\texttt{\#BSUB -x} with SLURM and \texttt{\#\$ -l exclusive=TRUE} with Sun Grid Engine (SGE).

\section{Compiling on an IBM BlueGene}

\underline{More recent installation instruction for IBM BlueGene, from October 2012:}\\

\noindent
Edit file \texttt{flags.guess} and put this for \texttt{FLAGS\_CHECK}:\\

\noindent
\texttt{-g -qfullpath -O2 -qsave -qstrict -qtune=qp -qarch=qp -qcache=auto -qhalt=w}\\
\noindent
\texttt{-qfree=f90 -qsuffix=f=f90 -qlanglvl=95pure -Q -Q+rank,swap\_all -Wl,-relax}\\

\noindent
The most relevant are the -qarch and -qtune flags, otherwise if these flags are set to ``auto'' then they are wrongly assigned to
the architecture of the frond-end node, which is different from that on the compute nodes.
You will need to set these flags to the right architecture for your BlueGene compute nodes, which is not necessarily ``qp'';
ask your system administrator.
On some machines if is necessary to use -O2 in these flags instead of -O3 due to a compiler bug of the XLF version installed.
We thus suggest to first try -O3, and then if the code does not compile or does not run fine then switch back to -O2.
The debug flags (-g, -qfullpath) do not influence performance but are useful to get at least some insights in case of problems.\\

\noindent
Before running \texttt{configure}, select the XL Fortran compiler by typing \texttt{module load bgq-xl/1.0}
or \texttt{module load bgq-xl} (another, less efficient option is to load the GNU compilers using \texttt{module load bgq-gnu/4.4.6} or similar).\\

\noindent
Then, to configure the code, type this:\\

\noindent
\texttt{./configure FC=bgxlf90\_r MPIFC=mpixlf90\_r CC=bgxlc\_r LOCAL\_PATH\_IS\_ALSO\_GLOBAL=true}\\

\noindent
\underline{Older installation instruction for IBM BlueGene, from 2011:}\\

\noindent
To compile the code on an IBM BlueGene, Laurent L\'eger from IDRIS, France, suggests the following: compile the code with

\noindent
\texttt{   FLAGS\_CHECK="-O3 -qsave -qstrict -qtune=auto -qarch=450d -qcache=auto \\}
\texttt{   -qfree=f90 -qsuffix=f=f90 -g -qlanglvl=95pure -qhalt=w -Q -Q+rank,swap\_all -Wl,-relax"}

\noindent
Option "-Wl,-relax" must be added on many (but not all) BlueGene systems to be able to link the binaries \texttt{xmeshfem3D}
and \texttt{xspecfem3D} because the final link step is done by the GNU \texttt{ld} linker even if
one uses \texttt{FC=bgxlf90\_r, MPIFC=mpixlf90\_r} and \texttt{CC=bgxlc\_r} to create all the object files.
On the contrary, on some BlueGene systems that use the native AIX linker option "-Wl,-relax" can lead to problems and must be suppressed from \texttt{flags.guess}.

\noindent
One then just needs to pass the right commands to the \texttt{configure} script:

\noindent
\texttt{   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/SPECFEM3DG\_SP --host=Babel --build=BGP \\}
\texttt{      FC=bgxlf90\_r MPIFC=mpixlf90\_r CC=bgxlc\_r  \\}
\texttt{      LOCAL\_PATH\_IS\_ALSO\_GLOBAL=false}

\noindent
This trick can be useful for all hosts on which one needs to cross-compile.

\noindent
On BlueGene, one also needs to run the \texttt{xcreate\_header\_file} binary file manually rather than in the Makefile:

\noindent
   \texttt{bgrun -np 1 -mode VN -exe ./bin/xcreate\_header\_file}

\section{Using a cross compiler}

The \texttt{``configure''} script assumes that you will compile the code on the same kind of hardware
as the machine on which you will run it. On some systems (for instance IBM BlueGene, see also the previous section) this might not be the case
and you may compile the code using a cross compiler on a frontend computer that does not have the same
architecture. In such a case, typing \texttt{``make all''} on the frontend will fail, but you can use one of these two solutions: \\

\noindent
1/ create a script that runs \texttt{``make all''} on a node instead of on the frontend, if the compiler is also installed on the nodes \\

\noindent
2/ after running the \texttt{``configure''} script, create two copies of the Makefiles:
\\
\red{TODO: this has not been tested out yet, any feedback is welcome}
\\

\noindent
In \texttt{src/create\_header\_file/Makefile} put this instead of the current values:

\begin{verbatim}
FLAGS_CHECK = -O0
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
and replace

\begin{verbatim}
create_header_file: $O/create_header_file.o $(XCREATE_HEADER_OBJECTS)
 ${FCCOMPILE_CHECK} -o ${E}/xcreate_header_file $O/create_header_file.o $(XCREATE_HEADER_OBJECTS)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
with

\begin{verbatim}
xcreate_header_file: $O/create_header_file.o $(XCREATE_HEADER_OBJECTS)
  ${MPIFCCOMPILE_CHECK} -o ${E}/xcreate_header_file $O/create_header_file.o $(XCREATE_HEADER_OBJECTS)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
In \texttt{src/specfem3D/Makefile} comment out these last two lines:

\begin{verbatim}
#${OUTPUT}/values_from_mesher.h: reqheader
#       (mkdir -p ${OUTPUT}; cd ${S_TOP}/; ./bin/xcreate_header_file)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Then:

\begin{verbatim}
 make clean
 make create_header_file
 ./bin/xcreate_header_file
 make clean
 make meshfem3D
 make specfem3D
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
should work.

\section{Adding OpenMP support in addition to MPI}

OpenMP support can be enabled in addition to MPI. However, in many cases performance will not improve
because our pure MPI implementation is already heavily optimized and thus the resulting code will in fact
be slightly slower. A possible exception could be IBM BlueGene-type architectures.

To enable OpenMP, uncomment the OpenMP compiler option in two lines in file \texttt{src/specfem3D/Makefile.in}
(before running \texttt{configure}) and also uncomment the \texttt{\#define USE\_OPENMP} statement in file\\
\texttt{src/specfem3D/specfem3D.F90}.

The DO-loop using OpenMP threads has a SCHEDULE property. The OMP\_SCHEDULE
environment variable can set the scheduling policy of that DO-loop.
Tests performed by Marcin Zielinski at SARA (The Netherlands) showed that often
the best scheduling policy is DYNAMIC with the size of the chunk equal to the number of
OpenMP threads, but most preferably being twice as the number of
OpenMP threads (thus chunk size = 8 for 4 OpenMP threads etc).
If OMP\_SCHEDULE is not set or is empty, the DO-loop will assume generic
scheduling policy, which will slow down the job quite a bit.

\section{Visualizing the subroutine calling tree of the source code}

Packages such as \texttt{doxywizard} can be used to visualize the subroutine calling tree of the source code.
\texttt{Doxywizard} is a GUI front-end for configuring and running \texttt{doxygen}.

\chapter{\label{cha:Running-the-Mesher}Running the Mesher \texttt{xmeshfem3D}}

You are now ready to compile the mesher. In the directory with the
source code, type `\texttt{make meshfem3D}'. If all paths and flags
have been set correctly, the mesher should now compile and produce
the executable \texttt{xmeshfem3D}.
Note that all compiled executables are placed into the directory \texttt{bin/}.
To run the executables, you must call them from the root directory,
for example type `\texttt{mpirun -np 64 ./bin/meshfem3D}` to run the mesher
in parallel on 64 CPUs. This will allow the executables to find the parameter file
\texttt{Par\_file} in the relative directory location \texttt{./DATA}.

Input for the mesher (and the solver) is provided through the parameter
file \texttt{Par\_file}, which resides in the subdirectory \texttt{DATA}.
Before running the mesher, a number of parameters need to be set in
the \texttt{Par\_file}. This requires a basic understanding of how
the SEM is implemented, and we encourage you to read \citet{KoVi98,KoTr99,Ch00,KoTr02a,KoTr02b,KoRiTr02,ChCaVi03,CaChViMo03}
and \citet{ChVa04}. A detailed theoretical analysis of the dispersion
and stability properties of the SEM is available in \citet{Coh02}, \citet{DeSe07}
and \citet{SeOl07}.


In this chapter we will focus on simulations at the scale of the entire
globe. Regional simulations will be addressed in Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations}.
The spectral-element mesh for a SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE simulation is based
upon a mapping from the cube to the sphere called the \textit{cubed
sphere} \citep{Sad72,RoIaPa96}. This cubed-sphere mapping breaks
the globe into 6~chunks, each of which is further subdivided in terms
of $n^{2}$ mesh slices, where $n\ge1$ is a positive integer, for
a total of $6\times n^{2}$ slices (Figure~\ref{figure:mpi_slices}).
Thus the minimum number of processors required for a global simulation
is 6 (although it is theoretically possible to run more than one slice
per processor). %
\begin{figure}
\centerline{ \begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/mpi_slices}  & \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/fullmesh_18} \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}}

\caption{Each of the 6~chunks that constitutes the cubed sphere is subdivided
in terms of $n^{2}$~slices of elements, where $n\ge1$ is a positive
integer, for a total of $6\times n^{2}$ slices (and therefore processors).
The figure on the left shows a mesh that is divided in terms of $6\times5^{2}=150$
slices as indicated by the various colors. In this cartoon, each slice
contains $5\times5=25$ spectral elements at the Earth's surface.
The figure on the right shows a mesh that is divided over $6\times18^{2}=1944$
processors as indicated by the various colors. Regional simulations
can be accommodated by using only 1, 2 or 3 chunks of the cubed sphere.
One-chunk simulations may involve a mesh with lateral dimensions smaller
than~$90^{\circ}$, thereby accommodating smaller-scale simulations. }


\label{figure:mpi_slices}
\end{figure}


To run the mesher for a global simulation, the following parameters
need to be set in the \texttt{Par\_file}:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE}}] is set to 1 for forward simulations,
2 for adjoint simulations for sources (see Section \ref{sec:Adjoint-simulation-sources})
and 3 for kernel simulations (see Section \ref{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}).
\item [{\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD}}] is only set to \texttt{.true.} for a forward
simulation with the last frame of the simulation saved, as part of
the finite-frequency kernel calculations (see Section \ref{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}).
For a regular forward simulation, leave \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE}
and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} at their default values.
\item [{\texttt{NCHUNKS}}] must be set to 6 for global simulations.
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Not needed for a global
simulation. (See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations} for regional
simulations.)
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_ETA\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Not needed for a global
simulation. (See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations} for regional
simulations.)
\item [{\texttt{CENTER\_LATITUDE\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Not needed for a global
simulation. (See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations} for regional
simulations.)
\item [{\texttt{CENTER\_LONGITUDE\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Not needed for a global
simulation. (See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations} for regional
simulations.)
\item [{\texttt{GAMMA\_ROTATION\_AZIMUTH}}] Not needed for a global simulation.
(See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations}  for regional simulations.)
\item [{$\nexxi$}] The number of spectral elements along one side of a
chunk in the cubed sphere (see Figure~\ref{figure:mpi_slices});
this number \textit{must} be a multiple of 16 and 8~$\times$~a
multiple of $\nprocxi$ defined below. We do not recommend using $\nexxi$
less than 64 because the curvature of the Earth cannot be honored
if one uses too few elements, and distorted elements can lead to inaccurate
and unstable simulations, i.e., smaller values of $\nexxi$ are likely
to result in spectral elements with a negative Jacobian, in which
case the mesher will exit with an error message. Table~\ref{table:nex}
summarizes various suitable choices for $\nexxi$ and the related
values of $\nprocxi$. Based upon benchmarks against semi-analytical
normal-mode synthetic seismograms, \citet{KoTr02a,KoTr02b} determined
that a $\nexxi=256$ run is accurate to a shortest period of roughly
17~s. Therefore, since accuracy is determined by the number of grid
points per shortest wavelength, for any particular value of $\nexxi$
the simulation will be accurate to a shortest period determined approximately
by \begin{equation}
\mbox{shortest period (s)}\simeq(256/\nexxi)\times17.\label{eq:shortest_period}\end{equation}
 The number of grid points in each orthogonal direction of the reference
element, i.e., the number of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points, is determined
by \texttt{NGLLX} in the \texttt{constants.h} file. In the globe we
use $\mbox{\texttt{NGLLX}}=5$, for a total of $5^{3}=125$ points
per elements. We suggest not to change this value.
\item [{$\nexeta$}] For global simulations $\nexeta$ must be set to the
same value as $\nexxi$.
\item [{$\nprocxi$}] The number of processors or slices along one chunk
of the cubed sphere (see Figure~\ref{figure:mpi_slices}); we must
have $\nexxi=8\times c\times\nprocxi$, where $c\ge1$ is a positive
integer. See Table~\ref{table:nex} for various suitable choices.
\item [{$\nproceta$}] For global simulations $\nproceta$ must be set
to the same value as $\nprocxi$.
\item [{\texttt{MODEL}}] Must be set to one of the following:
\item [{\textmd{1D~models~with~real~structure:}}]~

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{1D\_isotropic\_prem}}] Isotropic version of the spherically
symmetric Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) \citep{DzAn81}.
\item [{\texttt{1D\_transversely\_isotropic\_prem}}] Transversely isotropic
version of PREM.
\item [{\texttt{1D\_iasp91}}] Spherically symmetric isotropic IASP91 model
\citep{KeEn91}.
\item [{\texttt{1D\_1066a}}] Spherically symmetric earth model 1066A \citep{gilbertdziewonski1975}.
When \texttt{\small ATTENTUATION} is on, it uses an unpublished 1D
attenuation model from Scripps.
\item [{\texttt{1D\_ak135f\_no\_mud}}] Spherically symmetric isotropic AK135 model
\citep{KeEnBu95} modified to use the density and Q attenuation models of \cite{MoKe95}.
That modified model is traditionally called AK135-F,
see \url{http://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/ak135/ak135f.html} for more details.
As we do not want to use the 300~m-thick mud layer from that model nor the ocean layer,
above the d120 discontinuity we switch back to the classical AK135 model of \cite{KeEnBu95},
i.e., we use AK135-F below and AK135 above.
\item [{\texttt{1}D\_ref}] A recent 1D Earth model developed by \citet{KuDzEk06}.
This model is the 1D background model for the 3D models s362ani, s362wmani,
s362ani\_prem, and s29ea.
\end{description}
\end{description}
For historical reasons and to provide benchmarks against normal-mode
synthetics, the mesher accommodates versions of various 1D models
with a single crustal layer with the properties of the original upper
crust. These `one-crust' models are:

\texttt{1D\_isotropic\_prem\_onecrust}

\texttt{1D\_transversely\_isotropic\_prem\_onecrust}

\texttt{1D\_iasp91\_onecrust}, \texttt{1D\_1066a\_onecrust}

\texttt{1D\_ak135f\_no\_mud\_onecrust}

\begin{description}
\item [{\textmd{Fully~3D~models:}}]~

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{transversely\_isotropic\_prem\_plus\_3D\_crust\_2.0}}] This
model has CRUST2.0 \citep{BaLaMa00} on top of a transversely isotropic
PREM. We first extrapolate PREM mantle velocity up to the surface,
then overwrite the model with CRUST2.0
\item [{\texttt{s20rts}}] By default, the code uses 3D mantle model S20RTS
\citep{RiVaWo99} and 3D crustal model Crust2.0 \citep{BaLaMa00}.
Note that S20RTS uses transversely isotropic PREM as a background
model, and that we use the PREM radial attenuation model when \texttt{ATTENUATION}
is incorporated. See Chapter~\ref{cha:-Changing-the} for a discussion
on how to change 3D models.
\item [{\texttt{s40rts}}] A global 3D mantle model \citep{RiDeVaWo10} succeeding S20RTS
with a higher resolution.
S40RTS uses transversely isotropic PREM as a background
model and the 3D crustal model Crust2.0 \citep{BaLaMa00}.
We use the PREM radial attenuation model when \texttt{ATTENUATION}
is incorporated.
\item [{\texttt{\textcolor{black}{s362ani}}}] A global shear-wave speed
model developed by \citet{KuDzEk06}. In this model, radial anisotropy
is confined to the uppermost mantle. The model (and the corresponding
mesh) incorporate tomography on the 650\textasciitilde{}km and 410\textasciitilde{}km
discontinuities in the 1D reference model REF.
\item [{\texttt{\textcolor{black}{s362wmani}}}] A version of S362ANI with
anisotropy allowed throughout the mantle.
\item [{\texttt{\textcolor{black}{s362ani\_prem}}}] A version of S362ANI
calculated using PREM as the 1D reference model.
\item [{\texttt{\textcolor{black}{s29ea}}}] A global model with higher
resolution in the upper mantle beneath Eurasia calculated using REF
as the 1D reference model.
\item [{\texttt{3D\_anisotropic}}] See Chapter~\ref{cha:-Changing-the}
for a discussion on how to specify your own 3D anisotropic model.
\item [{\texttt{3D\_attenuation}}] See Chapter~\ref{cha:-Changing-the}
for a discussion on how to specify your own 3D attenuation model.
\item [{\texttt{PPM}}] For a user-specified 3D model (Point-Profile-Model)
given as ASCII-table, specifying Vs-perturbations
with respect to PREM. See Chapter~\ref{cha:-Changing-the}
for a discussion on how to specify your own 3D model.
\end{description}
\item [{\textmd{NOTE:}}]~\\
When a 3D mantle model is chosen in \texttt{Par\_file}, the simulations are performed together with the 3D crustal model Crust2.0. Alternatively, Crust2.0 can be combined with a higher resolution European crustal model EUCrust07 \citep{EUCrust07}. This can be done by setting the crustal type to \texttt{ICRUST\_CRUSTMAPS} in the \texttt{constant.h} file.
It is also possible to run simulations using a 3D mantle model with a 1D crustal model on top. This can be done by setting the model in \texttt{Par\_file} to \texttt{<3D mantle>\_1Dcrust}, e.g., \texttt{s20rts\_1Dcrust, s362ani\_1Dcrust}, etc. In this case, the 1D crustal model will be the one that is used in the 3D mantle model as a reference model (e.g., transversely isotropic PREM for s20rts, REF for s362ani, etc.).

\item [{\texttt{OCEANS}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if the effect of the oceans
on seismic wave propagation should be incorporated based upon the
approximate treatment discussed in \citet{KoTr02b}. This feature
is inexpensive from a numerical perspective, both in terms of memory
requirements and CPU time. This approximation is accurate at periods
of roughly 20~s and longer. At shorter periods the effect of water
phases/reverberations is not taken into account, even when the flag
is on.
\item [{\texttt{ELLIPTICITY}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if the mesh should
make the Earth model elliptical in shape according to Clairaut's equation
\citep{DaTr98}. This feature adds no cost to the simulation.
\item [{\texttt{TOPOGRAPHY}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if topography and
bathymetry should be incorporated based upon model ETOPO5 \citep{Etopo5}.
This feature adds no cost to the simulation.
\item [{\texttt{GRAVITY}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if self-gravitation should
be incorporated in the Cowling approximation \citep{KoTr02b,DaTr98}.
Turning this feature on is relatively inexpensive, both from the perspective
of memory requirements as well as in terms of computational speed.
\item [{\texttt{ROTATION}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if the Coriolis effect
should be incorporated. Turning this feature on is relatively cheap
numerically.
\item [{\texttt{ATTENUATION}}] Set to \texttt{.true.} if attenuation should
be incorporated. Turning this feature on increases the memory requirements
significantly (roughly by a factor of~2), and is numerically fairly
expensive. Of course for realistic simulations this flag should be
turned on. See \citet{KoTr99,KoTr02a} for a discussion on the implementation
of attenuation based upon standard linear solids.
\item [{\texttt{ABSORBING\_CONDITIONS}}] Set to \texttt{.false.} for global
simulations. See Chapter~\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations} for regional
simulations.
\item [{\texttt{RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES}}] Choose the desired record
length of the synthetic seismograms (in minutes). This controls the
length of the numerical simulation, i.e., twice the record length
requires twice as much CPU time. This feature is not used at the time
of meshing but is required for the solver, i.e., you may change this
parameter after running the mesher.
\item [{\texttt{MOVIE\_SURFACE}}] Set to \texttt{.false.}, unless you want
to create a movie of seismic wave propagation on the Earth's surface.
Turning this option on generates large output files. See Section \ref{sec:Movies}
for a discussion on the generation of movies. This feature is not
used at the time of meshing but is relevant for the solver.
\item [{\texttt{MOVIE\_VOLUME}}] Set to \texttt{.false.}, unless you want
to create a movie of seismic wave propagation in the Earth's interior.
Turning this option on generates huge output files. See Section \ref{sec:Movies}
for a discussion on the generation of movies. This feature is not
used at the time of meshing but is relevant for the solver.
\item [{\texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_FRAMES}}] Determines the number of timesteps
between movie frames. Typically you want to save a snapshot every
100 timesteps. The smaller you make this number the more output will
be generated! See Section \ref{sec:Movies} for a discussion on the
generation of movies. This feature is not used at the time of meshing
but is relevant for the solver.
\item [{\texttt{HDUR\_MOVIE}}] determines the half duration of the source
time function for the movie simulations. When this parameter is set
to be 0, a default half duration that corresponds to the accuracy
of the simulation is provided.
\item [{\texttt{SAVE\_MESH\_FILES}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true}\texttt{\small .}
to save AVS \urlwithparentheses{www.avs.com}, OpenDX \urlwithparentheses{www.opendx.org}, or ParaView \urlwithparentheses{www.paraview.org}
mesh files for subsequent viewing. Turning the flag on generates large
(distributed) files in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} directory. See Section~\ref{sec:Meshes}
for a discussion of mesh viewing features.
\item [{\texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_RUNS}}] On machines with a run-time limit,
for instance for a batch/queue system, a simulation may need to be
completed in stages. This option allows you to select the number of
stages in which the simulation will be completed (1, 2 or 3). Choose
1 for a run without restart files. This feature is not used at the
time of meshing but is required for the solver. At the end of the
first or second stage of a multi-stage simulation, large files are
written to the file system to save the current state of the simulation.
This state is read back from the file system at the beginning of the
next stage of the multi-stage run. Reading and writing the states
can be very time consuming depending on the nature of the network
and the file system (in this case writing to the local file system,
i.e., the disk on a node, is preferable).
\item [{\texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_THIS\_RUN}}] If you choose to perform the run
in stages, you need to tell the solver what stage run to perform.
This feature is not used at the time of meshing but is required for
the solver.
\item [{\texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}}] Directory in which the databases generated
by the mesher will be written. Generally one uses a directory on the
local disk of the compute nodes, although on some machines these databases
are written on a parallel (global) file system (see also the earlier
discussion of the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH\_IS\_ALSO\_GLOBAL} flag in Chapter~\ref{cha:Getting-Started}).
The mesher generates the necessary databases in parallel, one set
for each of the $6\times\nprocxi^{2}$ slices that constitutes the
mesh (see Figure~\ref{figure:mpi_slices}). After the mesher finishes,
you can log in to one of the compute nodes and view the contents of
the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} directory to see the (many) files generated
by the mesher.
\item [{\texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_INFO}}] This parameter specifies
the interval at which basic information about a run is written to
the file system (\texttt{timestamp{*}} files in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES}
directory). If you have access to a fast machine, set \texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_INFO}
to a relatively high value (e.g., at least 100, or even 1000 or more)
to avoid writing output text files too often. This feature is not
used at the time of meshing. One can set this parameter to a larger
value than the number of time steps to avoid writing output during
the run.
\item [{\texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_SEISMOS}}] This parameter specifies
the interval at which synthetic seismograms are written in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}
directory. The seismograms can be created in three different formats
by setting the parameters \texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_ASCII\_TEXT}, \texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_ALPHANUM}
and \texttt{OUTPUT\_SEI-}~\\
\texttt{SMOS\_SAC\_BINARY}. One can choose any combination of these
parameters (details on the formats follow in the description of each
parameter). SAC \urlwithparentheses{www.iris.edu/software/sac/} is a signal-processing software
package. If a run crashes, you may still find usable (but shorter
than requested) seismograms in this directory. On a fast machine set
\texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_SEISMOS} to a relatively high value
to avoid writing to the seismograms too often. This feature is not
used at the time of meshing.
\item [{\texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_READ\_ADJSRC}}] The number of adjoint
sources read in each time for an adjoint simulation.
\item [{\texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_ASCII\_TEXT}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have the synthetic seismograms written in two-column
ASCII format (the first column contains time in seconds and the second
column the displacement in meters of the recorded signal, no header
information). Files will be named with extension \texttt{.ascii}, e.g., \texttt{STA.NT.?X?.sem.ascii} where STA and NT are the station and network codes given in \texttt{STATIONS} file, and \texttt{?X?} is the channel code (see Appendix~\ref{cha:channel-codes}).
\item [{\texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_ALPHANUM}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have the synthetic seismograms written in alphanumeric
(human readable) SAC format, which includes header information on
the source and receiver parameters (e.g., source/receiver coordinates,
station name, etc., see Appendix~\ref{cha:SAC-headers}). For details on the format, please check the SAC webpage \urlwithparentheses{www.iris.edu/software/sac/}. Files will be named with extension \texttt{.sacan}.
\item [{\texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_BINARY}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have the synthetic seismograms written in binary SAC
format. The header information included is the same as for the alphanumeric
SAC format (see Appendix~\ref{cha:SAC-headers}). Using this format requires the least disk space, which may be particulary important if you have a large number of stations.
For details on the binary format please also check the SAC webpage \urlwithparentheses{www.iris.edu/software/sac/} and Appendix~\ref{cha:SAC-headers}. Files will be named with extension \texttt{.sac}.
\item [{\texttt{ROTATE\_SEISMOGRAMS\_RT}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have radial (R) and transverse (T) horizontal components
of the synthetic seismograms (default is \texttt{.false.} $\rightarrow$
East (E) and North (N) components).
\item [{\texttt{WRITE\_SEISMOGRAMS\_BY\_MASTER}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have all the seismograms written by the master (no
need to collect them on the nodes after the run).
\item [{\texttt{SAVE\_ALL\_SEISMOS\_IN\_ONE\_FILE}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to have all the seismograms saved in one large combined
file instead of one file per seismogram to avoid overloading shared
non-local file systems such as GPFS for instance.
\item [{\texttt{USE\_BINARY\_FOR\_LARGE\_FILE}}] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.}
if you want to use binary instead of ASCII for that large file (not
used if SAVE\_ALL\_SEISMOS\_IN \_ONE\_FILE = .false.)
\item [{\texttt{RECEIVERS\_CAN\_BE\_BURIED}}] This flag accommodates stations
with instruments that are buried, i.e., the solver will calculate
seismograms at the burial depth specified in the \texttt{STATIONS}
file. This feature is not used at the time of meshing.
\item [{\texttt{PRINT\_SOURCE\_TIME\_FUNCTION}}] Turn this flag on to print
information about the source time function in the file \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/plot\_source\_time\_function.txt}.
This feature is not used at the time of meshing.

\caption{Sample choices for $\nexxi$ given $\nprocxi$ based upon the relationship

The approximate shortest period at which the global simulation is
accurate for a given value of $\nexxi$ can be estimated by running
the small serial program \texttt{xcreate\_header\_file}.}
\end{table}
\end{center}

Finally, you need to provide a file that tells MPI what compute nodes
to use for the simulations. The file must have a number of entries
(one entry per line) at least equal to the number of processors needed
for the run. A sample file is provided in the file \texttt{mymachines}.
This file is not used by the mesher or solver, but is required by
the \texttt{go\_mesher} and \texttt{go\_solver} default job submission
scripts. See Chapter \ref{cha:Running-Scheduler} for information
about running the code on a system with a scheduler, e.g., LSF.

Now that you have set the appropriate parameters in the \texttt{Par\_file}
and have compiled the mesher, you are ready to launch it! This is
most easily accomplished based upon the \texttt{go\_mesher} script.
When you run on a PC cluster, the script assumes that the nodes are
named n001, n002, etc. If this is not the case, change the \texttt{tr
-d `n'} line in the script. You may also need to edit the last command
at the end of the script that invokes the \texttt{mpirun} command.

Mesher output is provided in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory
in \texttt{output\_mesher.txt}; this file provides lots of details
about the mesh that was generated. Alternatively, output can be directed
to the screen instead by uncommenting a line in \texttt{constants.h}:

\begin{lyxcode}
!~uncomment~this~to~write~messages~to~the~screen~

!~integer,~parameter~::~IMAIN~=~ISTANDARD\_OUTPUT~~
\end{lyxcode}
Note that on very fast machines, writing to the screen may slow down
the code.

Another file generated by the mesher is the header file \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/values\_from\_mesher.h}.
This file specifies a number of constants and flags needed by the
solver. These values are passed statically to the solver for reasons
of speed. Some useful statistics about the mesh are also provided
in this file.

For a given model, set of nodes, and set of parameters in \texttt{Par\_file},
one only needs to run the mesher once and for all, even if one wants
to run several simulations with different sources and/or receivers
(the source and receiver information is used in the solver only).

Please note that it is difficult to correctly sample S waves in the
inner core of the Earth because S-wave velocity is very small there.
Therefore, correctly sampling S waves in the inner core would require
a very dense mesh, which in turn would drastically reduce the time
step of the explicit time scheme because the P wave velocity is very
high in the inner core (Poisson's ratio is roughly equal to 0.44).
Because shear wave attenuation is very high in the inner core ($Q_{\mu}$
is approximately equal to 85), we have therefore decided to design
the inner core mesh such that P waves are very well sampled but S
waves are right at the sampling limit or even slightly below. This
works fine because spurious numerical oscillations due to S-wave subsampling
are almost completely suppressed by attenuation. However, this implies
that one should not use SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE with the regular mesh and
period estimates of Table \ref{table:nex} to study the PKJKP phase
very precisely. If one is interested in that phase, one should use
typically 1.5 times to twice the number of elements NEX indicated
in the table.

Regarding fluid/solid coupling at the CMB and ICB, in SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE
we do not use the fluid-solid formulation of \citet{KoTr02a} and
\citet{KoTr02b} anymore, we now use a displacement potential in the
fluid (rather than a velocity potential as in \citet{KoTr02a} and
\citet{KoTr02b}). This leads to the simpler fluid-solid matching
condition introduced by \citet{ChVa04} with no numerical iterations
at the CMB and ICB.

For accuracy reasons, in the mesher the coordinates of the mesh points
(arrays xstore, ystore and zstore) are always created in double precision.
If the solver is compiled in single precision mode, the mesh coordinates
are converted to single precision before being saved in the local
mesh files.


\section{Memory requirements}

The SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE memory requirements can be estimated before or
after running the mesher using the small serial program \texttt{\small ./bin/xcreate\_header\_file},
which reads the input file \texttt{\small DATA/Par\_file} and displays
the total amount of memory that will be needed by the mesher and the
solver to run it. This way, users can easily modify the parameters
and check that their simulation will fit in memory on their machine.
The file created by \texttt{\small xcreate\_header\_file} is called
\texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/values\_from\_mesher.h} and contains even more
details about the future simulation.


\section{Checking the MPI Buffers (Optional)}

The mesher writes MPI communication tables in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES}
subdirectory in the files \texttt{addressing.txt}, \texttt{list\_messages\_corners.txt}
and \texttt{list\_messages\_faces.txt}, and MPI communication buffers
to the local disks. Use the four serial codes

\begin{lyxcode}
check\_buffers\_2D.f90

check\_buffers\_1D.f90

check\_buffers\_faces\_chunks.f90

check\_buffers\_corners\_chunks.f90~
\end{lyxcode}
to check that all the MPI buffers created by the mesher have been
generated correctly. For example, typing `\texttt{make check\_buffers\_2D}'
and then `\texttt{xcheck\_buffers\_2D}' checks the communication buffers
between faces common to the mesh slices. `\texttt{xcheck\_buffers\_1D}'
checks the communication buffers between edges common to the mesh
slices. `\texttt{xcheck\_buffers\_faces\_chunks}' checks the communication
buffers between faces common to the mesh chunks, i.e., the faces of
the six blocks of the cubed-sphere mesh. `\texttt{xcheck\_buffers\_corners\_chunks}'
checks the communication buffers between edges common to the mesh
chunks, which must be treated separately in MPI because they are of
valence 3 (i.e., they are shared between three chunks).

Please note that running these codes is optional because no information
needed by the solver is generated.

\chapter{\label{cha:Running-the-Solver}Running the Solver \texttt{xspecfem3D}}

Now that you have successfully run the mesher, you are ready to compile
the solver. For reasons of speed, the solver uses static memory allocation.
Therefore it needs to be recompiled (type `\texttt{make clean}' and
`\texttt{make specfem3D}') every time one reruns the mesher with different
parameters. To compile the solver one needs a file generated by the
mesher in the directory \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} called \texttt{values\_from\_mesher.h},
which contains parameters describing the static size of the arrays
as well as the setting of certain flags.

The solver needs three input files in the \texttt{DATA} directory
to run: the \texttt{Par\_file} that was discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{cha:Running-the-Mesher},
the earthquake source parameter file \texttt{CMTSOLUTION}, and the
stations file \texttt{STATIONS}. Most parameters in the \texttt{Par\_file}
should be set prior to running the mesher. Only the following parameters
may be changed after running the mesher:

\begin{itemize}
\item the simulation type control parameters: \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE}
and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD}
\item the record length \texttt{RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES}
\item the movie control parameters \texttt{MOVIE\_SURFACE}, \texttt{MOVIE\_VOLUME},
and \texttt{NTSTEPS\_BETWEEN\_FRAMES}
\item the multi-stage simulation parameters \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_RUNS} and
\texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_THIS\_RUN}
\item the output information parameters \texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_INFO,
NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_}~\\
\texttt{SEISMOS, OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_ASCII\_TEXT, OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_ALPHANUM,
OUTPUT\_}~\\
\texttt{SEISMOS\_SAC\_BINARY and ROTATE\_SEISMOGRAMS\_RT}
\item the \texttt{RECEIVERS\_CAN\_BE\_BURIED} and \texttt{PRINT\_SOURCE\_TIME\_FUNCTION}
flags
\end{itemize}
Any other change to the \texttt{Par\_file} implies rerunning both
the mesher and the solver.

For any particular earthquake, the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file that
represents the point source may be obtained directly from the Harvard Centroid-Moment Tensor (CMT) web page \urlwithparentheses{www.globalcmt.org}.
It looks like this:

\begin{lyxcode}
{\small }%
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
{\small \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Denali_CMT} }
\par\end{centering}{\small \par}

\caption{\texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file obtained from the Harvard CMT catalog. The
top line is the initial estimate of the source, which is used as a
starting point for the CMT solution. \textbf{M} is the moment tensor,
$M_{0}${\small{} }is the seismic moment, and $M_{w}$ is the moment
magnitude.}


\label{fig:CMTSOLUTION-file}
\end{figure}
{\small \par}
\end{lyxcode}
The \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} should be edited in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\item For point-source simulations (see finite sources, page \pageref{To-simulate-a})
we recommend setting the source half-duration parameter \texttt{half
duration} equal to zero, which corresponds to simulating a step source-time
function, i.e., a moment-rate function that is a delta function. If
\texttt{half duration} is not set to zero, the code will use a Gaussian
(i.e., a signal with a shape similar to a `smoothed triangle', as
explained in \citet{KoTr02a} and shown in Fig~\ref{fig:gauss.vs.triangle})
source-time function with half-width \texttt{half duration}. We prefer
to run the solver with \texttt{half duration} set to zero and convolve
the resulting synthetic seismograms in post-processing after the run,
because this way it is easy to use a variety of source-time functions
(see Section \ref{sec:Process-data-and-syn}). \citet{KoTr02a} determined
that the noise generated in the simulation by using a step source
time function may be safely filtered out afterward based upon a convolution
with the desired source time function and/or low-pass filtering. Use
the postprocessing script \texttt{process\_syn.pl} (see Section \ref{sub:process_syn.pl})
with the \texttt{-h} flag, or the serial code \texttt{convolve\_source\_timefunction.f90}
and the script \texttt{UTILS/convolve\_source\_timefunction.csh} for
this purpose, or alternatively use signal-processing software packages
such as SAC \urlwithparentheses{www.iris.edu/software/sac/}. Type

\begin{lyxcode}
make~convolve\_source\_timefunction
\end{lyxcode}
to compile the code and then set the parameter \texttt{hdur} in \texttt{UTILS/convolve\_source\_timefunction.csh}
to the desired half-duration.

\item The zero time of the simulation corresponds to the center of the triangle/Gaussian,
or the centroid time of the earthquake. The start time of the simulation
is $t=-1.5*\texttt{half duration}$ (the 1.5 is to make sure the moment
rate function is very close to zero when starting the simulation).
To convert to absolute time $t_{\mathrm{abs}}$, set

\begin{lyxcode}
$t_{\mathrm{abs}}=t_{\mathrm{pde}}+\texttt{time shift}+t_{\mathrm{synthetic}}$
\end{lyxcode}
where $t_{\mathrm{pde}}$ is the time given in the first line of the
\texttt{CMTSOLUTION}, \texttt{time shift} is the corresponding value
from the original \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file and $t_{\mathrm{synthetic}}$
is the time in the first column of the output seismogram.

\end{itemize}
%

\par\end{centering}
\caption{Comparison of the shape of a triangle and the Gaussian function actually used.}
\label{fig:gauss.vs.triangle}
\end{figure}

If you know the earthquake source in strike/dip/rake format rather than in \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} format,
use the C code \texttt{utils/strike\_dip\_rake\_to\_CMTSOLUTION.c} to convert it.
The conversion formulas are given for instance in \cite{AkRi80}.
Note that the \cite{AkRi80} convention is slightly different from the Harvard \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} convention
(the sign of some components is different). The C code outputs both.

Centroid latitude and longitude should be provided in geographical
coordinates. The code converts these coordinates to geocentric coordinates~\citep{DaTr98}.
Of course you may provide your own source representations by designing
your own \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file. Just make sure that the resulting
file adheres to the Harvard CMT conventions (see Appendix~\ref{cha:Reference-Frame-Convention}).
Note that the first line in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file is the Preliminary Determination of Earthquakes (PDE) solution performed by the USGS NEIC, which is used as a seed for the Harvard CMT inversion. The PDE solution is based upon P waves and often gives the hypocenter of the earthquake, i.e., the rupture initiation point, whereas the CMT solution gives the `centroid location', which is the location with dominant moment release. The PDE solution is not used by our software package but must be present anyway in the first line of the file.

In the current version of the code, the solver can run with a non-zero \texttt{time shift} in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file. Thus one does not need to set \texttt{time shift} to zero as it was the case for previous versions of the code. \texttt{time shift} is only used for writing centroid time in the SAC headers (see Appendix~\ref{cha:SAC-headers}). CMT time is obtained by adding \texttt{time shift} to the PDE time given in the first line in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file. Therefore it is recommended not to modify \texttt{time shift} to have the correct timing information in the SAC headers without any post-processing of seismograms.

\label{To-simulate-a}To simulate a kinematic rupture, i.e., a finite-source
event, represented in terms of $N_{\mathrm{sources}}$ point sources,
provide a \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file that has $N_{\mathrm{sources}}$
entries, one for each subevent (i.e., concatenate $N_{\mathrm{sources}}$
\texttt{CMTSOLUTION} files to a single \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file).
At least one entry (not necessarily the first) must have a zero \texttt{time
shift}, and all the other entries must have non-negative \texttt{time
shift}. If none of the entries has a zero \texttt{time shift} in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, the smallest \texttt{time shift} is subtracted from all sources to initiate the simulation. Each subevent can have its own half duration, latitude, longitude,
depth, and moment tensor (effectively, the local moment-density tensor).

Note that the zero in the synthetics does NOT represent the hypocentral
time or centroid time in general, but the timing of the \textit{center}
of the source triangle with zero \texttt{time shift} (Fig~\ref{fig:source_timing}).

Although it is convenient to think of each source as a triangle, in
the simulation they are actually Gaussians (as they have better frequency
characteristics). The relationship between the triangle and the Gaussian
used is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:gauss.vs.triangle}. For finite fault
simulations it is usually not advisable to use a zero half duration
and convolve afterwards, since the half duration is generally fixed
by the finite fault model.

\noindent \begin{centering}
{\small \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/source_timing} }
\par\end{centering}{\small \par}

\caption{Example of timing for three sources. The center of the first source
triangle is defined to be time zero. Note that this is NOT in general
the hypocentral time, or the start time of the source (marked as tstart).
The parameter \texttt{time shift} in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file
would be t1(=0), t2, t3 in this case, and the parameter \texttt{half
duration} would be hdur1, hdur2, hdur3 for the sources 1, 2, 3 respectively.}


{\small \label{fig:source_timing} }
\end{figure}
{\small \par}

The solver can calculate seismograms at any number of stations for
basically the same numerical cost, so the user is encouraged to include
as many stations as conceivably useful in the \texttt{STATIONS} file,
which looks like this:

{\small }%
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
{\small \includegraphics{figures/STATIONS_global_explained} }
\par\end{centering}{\small \par}

\caption{Sample \texttt{STATIONS} file. Station latitude and longitude should
be provided in geographical coordinates. The width of the station
label should be no more than 32 characters (see \texttt{MAX\_LENGTH\_STATION\_NAME}
in the \texttt{constants.h} file), and the network label should be
no more than 8 characters (see \texttt{MAX\_LENGTH\_NETWORK\_NAME}
in the \texttt{constants.h} file).}

\end{figure}
{\small \par}

Each line represents one station in the following format:

\begin{lyxcode}
\noindent {\small Station~Network~Latitude~(degrees)~Longitude~(degrees)~Elevation~(m)~burial~(m)~}{\small \par}
\end{lyxcode}
If you want to put a station on the ocean floor, just set
elevation and burial depth in the STATIONS file to 0.
Equivalently you can also set elevation to a negative value equal
to the ocean depth, and burial depth to 0.

Solver output is provided in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory
in the \texttt{output\_solver.txt} file. Output can be directed to
the screen instead by uncommenting a line in \texttt{constants.h}:

\begin{lyxcode}
!~uncomment~this~to~write~messages~to~the~screen~

!~integer,~parameter~::~IMAIN~=~ISTANDARD\_OUTPUT~
\end{lyxcode}
Note that on very fast machines, writing to the screen may slow down
the code.

While the solver is running, its progress may be tracked by monitoring
the `\texttt{timestamp{*}}' files in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory.
These tiny files look something like this:

\begin{lyxcode}
Time~step~\#~~~~~~~~~~~200~

Time:~~~~0.6956667~~~~~~minutes~

Elapsed~time~in~seconds~=~~~~~252.6748970000000~

Elapsed~time~in~hh:mm:ss~=~~~~0~h~04~m~12~s~

Mean~elapsed~time~per~time~step~in~seconds~=~~~~~1.263374485000000~

Max~norm~displacement~vector~U~in~solid~in~all~slices~(m)~=~~~~1.9325~

Max~non-dimensional~potential~Ufluid~in~fluid~in~all~slices~=~1.1058885E-22~
\end{lyxcode}
The \texttt{timestamp{*}} files provide the \texttt{Mean elapsed time
per time step in seconds}, which may be used to assess performance
on various machines (assuming you are the only user on a node), as
well as the \texttt{\small Max}{\small{} }\texttt{\small norm}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small displacement}{\small{} }\texttt{\small vector}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small U}{\small{} }\texttt{\small in}{\small{} }\texttt{\small solid}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small in}{\small{} }\texttt{\small all}{\small{} }\texttt{\small slices~(m)}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small and}{\small{} }\texttt{\small Max}{\small{} }\texttt{\small non-dimensional}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small potential}{\small{} }\texttt{\small Ufluid}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small in}{\small{} }\texttt{\small fluid}{\small{} }\texttt{\small in}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small all}{\small{} }\texttt{\small slices}. If something
is wrong with the model, the mesh, or the source, you will see the
code become unstable through exponentionally growing values of the
displacement and/or fluid potential with time, and ultimately the
run will be terminated by the program when either of these values
becomes greater than \texttt{STABILITY\_THRESHOLD} defined in \texttt{constants.h}.
You can control the rate at which the timestamp files are written
based upon the parameter \texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_OUTPUT\_INFO} in
the \texttt{Par\_file}.

Having set the \texttt{Par\_file} parameters, and having provided
the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} and \texttt{STATIONS} files, you are now
ready to launch the solver! This is most easily accomplished based
upon the \texttt{go\_solver} script (see Chapter~\ref{cha:Running-Scheduler}
for information about running the code through a scheduler, e.g.,
LSF). You may need to edit the last command at the end of the script
that invokes the \texttt{mpirun} command. Another option is to use
the \texttt{runall} script, which compiles and runs both mesher and
solver in sequence. This is a safe approach that ensures using the
correct combination of mesher output and solver input.

It is important to realize that the CPU and memory requirements of
the solver are closely tied to choices about attenuation (\texttt{ATTENUATION})
and the nature of the model (i.e., isotropic models are cheaper than
anisotropic models). We encourage you to run a variety of simulations
with various flags turned on or off to develop a sense for what is
involved.

For the same model, one can rerun the solver for different events
by simply changing the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, and/or for different
stations by changing the \texttt{STATIONS} file. There is no need
to rerun the mesher. Of course it is best to include as many stations
as possible, since this does not add significantly to the cost of
the simulation.


\chapter{\label{cha:Regional-Simulations}Regional Simulations}

The code has the option of running in 1-, 2-, 3- or 6-chunk mode.
The 1- or 2-chunk options may be used for higher resolution regional
simulations. A one-chunk mesh may have lateral dimensions other than
the customary $90^{\circ}$ per chunk, which can further increase
the resolution of the mesh, and thus reduce the shortest period in
the synthetic seismograms (but of course then also reducing the time
step in order for the simulation to remain stable). A disadvantage
of regional simulations is that one needs to use approximate absorbing
boundary conditions on the side and bottom edges of the model (e.g.,
see \citet{KoTr99} for a description of the paraxial boundary conditions
used). Figure~\vref{fig:3D-spectral-element-mesh} and Figure~\vref{fig:Close-up-view-of}
show an example of a one-chunk mesh centered on the Japan subduction
zone, applied in the Japan regional waveform simulation \citep{ChTrHeKa07}.


\section{One-Chunk Simulations\label{sec:One-Chunk-Simulations}}

For a one-chunk regional simulation the following parameters need
to be set in the \texttt{Par\_file}:

\begin{description}
\item [{$\nchunks$}] Must be set to 1.
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Denotes the width of
one side of the chunk ($90^{\circ}$or less).
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_ETA\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Denotes the width of
the second side of the chunk ($90^{\circ}$or less). Note that this
value may be different from \texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}.
\item [{\texttt{CENTER\_LATITUDE\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Defines the latitude of
the center of the chunk (degrees).
\item [{\texttt{CENTER\_LONGITUDE\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Defines the longitude
of the center of the chunk (degrees).
\item [{\texttt{GAMMA\_ROTATION\_AZIMUTH}}] Defines the rotation angle
of the chunk about its center measured counter clockwise from due
North (degrees). The corners of the mesh are output in \texttt{\small OUTPUT\_FILES/values\_from\_mesher.h}.
The output corner progression in \texttt{\small OUTPUT\_FILES/values\_from\_mesher.h}
is bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right. The rotation azimuth
can be changed in the \texttt{Par\_file} and the corners output \texttt{(}\texttt{\small OUTPUT\_FILES/}~\\
\texttt{\small values\_from\_mesher.h}\texttt{)} by using{\small{}
}\texttt{\small xcreate\_header\_file}. It is important to note that
the mesher or the solver does not need to be run to determine the
limits of a 1-chunk simulation.
\item [{$\nexxi$}] The number of spectral elements along the $\xi$ side
of the chunk. This number \textit{must} be 8~$\times$~a multiple
of $\nprocxi$ defined below. For a $90^{\circ}$ chunk, we do not
recommend using $\nexxi$ less than~64 because the curvature of the
Earth cannot be honored if one uses too few elements, which results
in inaccurate and unstable simulations.
\item [{$\nexeta$}] The number of spectral elements along the $\eta$
side of the chunk. This number \textit{must} be 8~$\times$~a multiple
of $\nproceta$ defined below. Note that in order to get elements
that are close to square on the Earth's surface, the following ratios
should be similar:

\begin{lyxcode}
$\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}/\nexxi$

$\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_ETA\_IN\_DEGREES}/\nexeta$~
\end{lyxcode}
Because of the geometry of the cubed sphere, the option of having
different values for $\nexxi$ and $\nexeta$ is available only for
regional simulations when $\nchunks=1$ (1/6th of the sphere).

\item [{$\nprocxi$}] The number of processors or mesh slices along the
$\xi$ side of the chunk. To accommodate the mesh doubling layers,
we must have $\nexxi=8\times c\times\nprocxi$, where $c\ge1$ is
a positive integer. See Table~\ref{table:nex} for various suitable
choices.
\item [{$\nproceta$}] The number of processors or slices along the $\eta$
side of the chunk; we must have $\nexeta=8\times c\times\nproceta$,
where $c\ge1$ is a positive integer. $\nprocxi$ and $\nproceta$
must be equal when $\nchunks=6$.

\item [{\texttt{ABSORBING\_CONDITIONS}}] Set to \texttt{.true.}{\small{}

description of the paraxial boundary conditions used. Note that these
conditions are never perfect, and in particular surface waves may
partially reflect off the artificial boundaries. Note also that certain
arrivals, e.g., PKIKPPKIKP, will be missing from the synthetics.
\end{description}
When the width of the chunk is different from $90^{\circ}$ (or the
number of elements is greater than 1248), the radial distribution
of elements needs to be adjusted as well to maintain spectral elements
that are as cube-like as possible. The code attempts to do this, but
be sure to view the mesh with your favorite graphics package to make
sure that the element are well behaved.
Remember: a high-quality mesh is paramount for accurate simulations.
In addition to a reorganization of the radial distribution of elements,
the time stepping and period range in which the attenuation is applied
is automatically determined. The minimum and maximum periods for attenuation
are:

\[
\omega_{max}=\omega_{min}\times10^{W_{3}}\]


\noindent where $W_{3}$ is the optimal width in frequency for 3 Standard
Linear Solids, about 1.75. See \texttt{\small read\_compute\_parameters.f90}
for more details.

The time stepping is determined in a similar fashion as Equation (48)
in \citet{KoTr02a}:

\begin{lyxcode}
dt~=~$S_{c}$~Element~Width~in~km~($r=$ICB)~/~Velocity~($r=$ICB)
\end{lyxcode}
where $S_{c}$ is the stability condition (about 0.4). We use the
radius at the inner core boundary because this is where the maximum
velocity/element width occurs. Again, see \texttt{\small read\_compute\_parameters}\texttt{.f90}
for all the details.

The approximate shortest period at which a regional simulation is
accurate may be determined based upon the relation \begin{equation}
\mbox{shortest period (s)}\simeq(256/\nexxi)\times(\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}/90)\times17.\label{eq:shortest_period_regional}\end{equation}



\section{Two-Chunk Simulations}

For a two-chunk regional simulation the following parameters need
to be set in the \texttt{Par\_file}:

\begin{description}
\item [{$\nchunks$}] Must be set to 2
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_XI\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Denotes the width of
one side of the chunk, and it has to be 90 degrees.
\item [{\texttt{ANGULAR\_WIDTH\_ETA\_IN\_DEGREES}}] Denotes the width of
the second side of the chunk, and it also has to be 90 degrees.
\end{description}
\texttt{NEX\_XI} and \texttt{NEX\_ETA} follow the same description
in Section \ref{sec:One-Chunk-Simulations}, however, they need to
be the same in this case. All other parameters are similar to the
one-chunk simulations, refer to Section \ref{sec:One-Chunk-Simulations}
for details.

\chapter{\label{cha:Adjoint-Simulations}Adjoint Simulations}

Adjoint simulations are generally performed for two distinct applications.
First, they can be used for earthquake source inversions, especially
earthquakes with large ruptures such as the Sumatra-Andaman event
\citep{LayKanamoriAmmon2005,AmmonJiThio2005,ParkSongTromp2005}. Second,
they can be used to generate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels
that are a critical part of tomographic inversions based upon 3D reference
models \citep{TrTaLi05,LiTr06,TrKoLi08,LiTr08}. In either case, source
parameter or velocity structure updates are sought to minimize a specific
misfit function (e.g., waveform or traveltime differences), and the
adjoint simulation provides a means of computing the gradient of the
misfit function and further reducing it in successive iterations.
Applications and procedures pertaining to source studies and finite-frequency
kernels are discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:Adjoint-simulation-sources}
and \ref{sec:Adjoint-simulation-finite}, respectively. The two related
parameters in the \texttt{Par\_file} are \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE}
(1, 2 or 3) and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} (boolean).


\section{\label{sec:Adjoint-simulation-sources}Adjoint Simulations for Sources Only (not for the Model)}

In the case where a specific misfit function is minimized to invert
for the earthquake source parameters, the gradient of the misfit function
with respect to these source parameters can be computed by placing
time-reversed seismograms at the receivers and using them as sources
in an adjoint simulation, and then the value of the gradient is obtained
from the adjoint seismograms recorded at the original earthquake location.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Prepare the adjoint sources} \label{enu:Prepare-the-adjoint}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, run a regular forward simlation (\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE =
1} and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD = .false.}). You can automatically set
these two variables using the \texttt{\small UTILS/change\_simulation\_type.pl}
script:

\begin{lyxcode}
UTILS/change\_simulation\_type.pl~-f~
\end{lyxcode}
and then collect the recorded seismograms at all the stations given
in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS}.

\item Then select the stations for which you want to compute the time-reversed
adjoint sources and run the adjoint simulation, and compile them into
the \texttt{DATA/STATIONS\_ADJOINT} file, which has the same format
as the regular \texttt{DATA/STATIONS} file.

\begin{itemize}
\item Depending on what type of misfit function is used for the source inversion,
adjoint sources need to be computed from the original recorded seismograms
for the selected stations and saved in the \texttt{SEM/} directory
with the format \texttt{STA.NT.?X?.adj}, where \texttt{STA}, \texttt{NT}
are the station name and network code given in the \texttt{DATA/STATIONS\_ADJOINT}
file, and \texttt{?X?}  represents the channel name of a particular
adjoint seismogram where the first letter corresponds to the band code governed by the resolution of simulations, for example, generally \texttt{MX?} for the current resolution of global simulations (see Appendix~\ref{cha:channel-codes} for details). The last letter of channel names is the component name \texttt{E/N/Z}.
\item The adjoint seismograms are in the same format as the original seismogram
(\texttt{STA.NT.?X?.sem?}), with the same start time, time interval
and record length.
\end{itemize}
\item Notice that even if you choose to time reverse only one component
from one specific station, you still need to supply all three components
because the code is expecting them (you can set the other two components
to be zero).
\item Also note that since time-reversal is done in the code itself, no
explicit time-reversing is needed for the preparation of the adjoint
sources, i.e., the adjoint sources are in the same forward time sense
as the original recorded seismograms.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set the related parameters and run the adjoint simulation}\\
In the \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}, set the two related parameters to
be \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE = 2} and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD = .false.}.
More conveniently, use the scripts \texttt{UTILS/change\_simulation\_type.pl}
to modify the \texttt{Par\_file} automatically (\texttt{change\_simulation\_type.pl
-a}). Then run the solver to launch the adjoint simulation.
\item \textbf{Collect the seismograms at the original source location}


After the adjoint simulation has completed successfully, get the seismograms
from directory \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES}.

\begin{itemize}
\item These adjoint seismograms are recorded at the locations of the original
earthquake sources given by the \texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION} file, and
have names of the form \texttt{S?????.NT.S??.sem} for the six-component
strain tensor (\texttt{SNN,SEE,SZZ,SNE,SNZ,SEZ}) at these locations,
and \texttt{S?????.NT.?X?.sem} for the three-component displacements
(i.e., \texttt{MXN,MXE,MXZ}) recorded at these locations.
\item \texttt{S?????} denotes the source number; for example, if the original
\texttt{CMTSOLUTION} provides only a point source, then the seismograms
collected will start with \texttt{S00001}.
\item These adjoint seismograms provide critical information for the computation
of the gradient of the misfit function.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{\label{sec:Adjoint-simulation-finite}Adjoint Simulations for Finite-Frequency
Kernels (Kernel Simulation)}

Finite-frequency sensitivity kernels are computed in two successive
simulations (please refer to \citet{LiTr06} and \citet{TrKoLi08} for details).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Run a forward simulation with the state variables saved at
the end of the simulation}


Prepare the \texttt{\small CMTSOLUTION} and \texttt{\small STATIONS}
files, set the parameters \texttt{\small SIMULATION\_TYPE}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small =}{\small{} }\texttt{\small 1} and \texttt{\small SAVE\_FORWARD
=}{\small{} }\texttt{\small .true.} in the \texttt{Par\_file} (\texttt{change\_simulation\_type
-F}), and run the solver.

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that attenuation is not fully implemented yet for the computation
of finite-frequency kernels; if \texttt{ATTENUATION = .true.} is set
in the \texttt{Par\_file}, only effects on phase shift are accounted for
but not on amplitude of the signals. However, we suggest you use the same
setting for \texttt{ATTENUATION} as for your forward simulations.
\item We also suggest you modify the half duration of the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION}
to be similar to the accuracy of the simulation (see Equation \ref{eq:shortest_period}
or \ref{eq:shortest_period_regional}) to avoid too much high-frequency
noise in the forward wavefield, although theoretically the high-frequency
noise should be eliminated when convolved with an adjoint wavefield
with the proper frequency content.
\item This forward simulation differs from the regular simulations (\texttt{\small SIMULATION\_TYPE}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small =}{\small{} }\texttt{\small 1} and \texttt{\small SAVE\_FORWARD}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small =}{\small{} }\texttt{\small .false.}) described in
the previous chapters in that the state variables for the last time
step of the simulation, including wavefields of the displacement,
velocity, acceleration, etc., are saved to the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}
to be used for the subsequent simulation.
\item For regional simulations, the files recording the absorbing boundary
contribution are also written to the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} when \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD
= .true.}.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prepare the adjoint sources}


The adjoint sources need to be prepared the same way as described
in Section~\ref{sec:Adjoint-simulation-sources}, item~\ref{enu:Prepare-the-adjoint}.

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case of traveltime finite-frequency kernel for one source-receiver
pair, i.e., point source from the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION}, and one station
in the \texttt{STATIONS\_ADJOINT} list, we supply a sample program
in \texttt{UTILS/adjoint\_sources/traveltime} to cut a certain portion of the original
displacement seismograms and convert them into the proper adjoint
source to compute the finite-frequency kernel.
\begin{lyxcode}
xcreate\_adjsrc\_traveltime~t1~t2~ifile{[}0-5]~E/N/Z-ascii-files~{[}baz]
\end{lyxcode}
where \texttt{t1} and \texttt{t2} are the start and end time of the
portion you are interested in, \texttt{ifile} denotes the component
of the seismograms to be used (0 for all three components, 1 for east,
2 for north, and 3 for vertical, 4 for transverse, and 5 for radial
component), \texttt{E/N/Z-ascii-files} indicate the three-component
displacement seismograms in the right order, and \texttt{baz} is the
back-azimuth of the station from the event location. Note that \texttt{baz}
is only supplied when \texttt{ifile} = 4 or 5.

\item Similarly, a sample program to compute adjoint sources for amplitude finite-frequency kernels may be found in \texttt{UTILS/adjoint\_sources/amplitude} and used in the same way as described
for traveltime measurements
\begin{lyxcode}
xcreate\_adjsrc\_amplitude~t1~t2~ifile{[}0-5]~E/N/Z-ascii-files~{[}baz].
\end{lyxcode}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Run the kernel simulation}


With the successful forward simulation and the adjoint source ready
in \texttt{SEM/}, set \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE = 3} and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD
= .false.} in the \texttt{Par\_file(change\_simulation\_type.pl -b)},
and rerun the solver.

\begin{itemize}
\item The adjoint simulation is launched together with the back reconstruction
of the original forward wavefield from the state variables saved from
the previous forward simulation, and the finite-frequency kernels
are computed by the interaction of the reconstructed forward wavefield
and the adjoint wavefield.
\item The back-reconstructed seismograms at the original station locations
are saved to the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory at the end of the
kernel simulations.
\item These back-constructed seismograms can be compared with the time-reversed
original seismograms to assess the accuracy of the backward reconstruction,
and they should match very well (in the time-reversed sense).
\item The files containing the density, P-wave speed and S-wave speed kernels
are saved in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} with the names of \texttt{proc??????\_reg\_?\_rho(alpha,beta)\_kernel.bin},
where \texttt{proc??????} represents the processor number, and \texttt{reg\_?}
denotes the region these kernels are for, including mantle (\texttt{reg\_1}),
outer core (\texttt{reg\_2}), and inner core (\texttt{reg\_3}). The
output kernels are in the unit of $s/km^{3}$.
\item Note that if you set the flag \texttt{APPROXIMATE\_HESS\_KL = .true.} in
the \texttt{constants.h} file and recompile the solver, the adjoint simulation
also saves files \texttt{proc??????\_reg\_1\_hess\_kernel.bin} which can
be used as preconditioners in the crust-mantle region for iterative inverse
optimization schemes.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Run the boundary kernel simulation}


\noindent If you set the \texttt{SAVE\_BOUNDARY\_MESH = .true.} in
the \texttt{constants.h} file before the simulations, i.e., at the
beginning of step 1, you will get not only the volumetric kernels
as described in step 3, but also boundary kernels for the Earth's
internal discontinuities, such as Moho, 410-km discontinuity, 670-km
discontinuity, CMB and ICB. These kernel files are also saved in the
local scratch directory defined by \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH }and have names
such as \texttt{proc??????\_reg\_1(2)\_Moho(d400,d670,CMB,ICB)\_kernel.bin}.
For a theoretical derivation of the boundary kernels, refer to \citet{TrTaLi05},
and for the visualization of the boundary kernels, refer to Section
\ref{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}.

\item \textbf{Run the anisotropic kernel simulation}


Instead of the kernels for the isotropic wave speeds, you can also
compute the kernels for the 21 independent components $C_{IJ},\, I,J=1,...,6$
(using Voigt's notation) of the elastic tensor in the (spherical)
geographical coordinate system. This is done by setting \texttt{ANISOTROPIC\_KL}
\texttt{=} \texttt{.true.} in \texttt{constants.h} before step 3.
The definition of the parameters $C_{IJ}$ in terms of the corresponding
components $c_{ijkl},ijkl,i,j,k,l=1,2,3$ of the elastic tensor in
spherical coordinates follows \citet{ChTr07}. The computation of
the anisotropic kernels is only implemented in the crust and mantle
regions. The 21 anisotropic kernels are saved in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}
in one file with the name of \texttt{proc??????\_reg1\_cijkl\_kernel.bin}
(with \texttt{proc??????} the processor number). The output kernels
correspond to perturbation $\delta C_{IJ}$ of the elastic parameters
and their unit is in $s/GPa/km^{3}$. For consistency, the output
density kernels with this option turned on are for a perturbation
$\delta\rho$ (and not $\frac{\delta\rho}{\rho}$) and their unit
is in s / (kg/m$^{3}$) / km$^{3}$. These `primary' anisotropic kernels
can then be combined to obtain the kernels related to other descriptions
of anisotropy. This can be done, for example, when combining the kernel
files from slices into one mesh file (see Section~\ref{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}).

\end{enumerate}
In general, the first three steps need to be run sequentially to ensure
proper access to the necessary files at different stages. If the simulations
are run through some cluster scheduling system (e.g., LSF), and the
forward simulation and the subsequent kernel simulations cannot be
assigned to the same set of computer nodes, the kernel simulation
will not be able to access the database files saved by the forward
simulation. Solutions for this problem are provided in Chapter~\ref{cha:Running-Scheduler}.
Visualization of the finite-frequency kernels is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}.

\chapter{Noise Cross-correlation Simulations}

The new version of SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE includes functionality for seismic noise tomography.
Users are recommended to familiarize themselves first with the procedures for running regular earthquake
simulations (Chapters \ref{cha:Running-the-Mesher}--\ref{cha:Regional-Simulations}) and
adjoint simulations (Chapter \ref{cha:Adjoint-Simulations}).
Also, make sure you read the paper `Noise cross-correlation sensitivity kernels' \citep{trompetal2010}
in order to understand noise simulations from a theoretical perspective.

\section{New Requirements on `Old' Input Parameter Files}

As usual, the three main input files are crucial: \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}, \texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION} and
\texttt{DATA/STATIONS}.\\

\texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION} is required for all simulations. However, it may seem unexpected to have it listed here, since the
noise simulations should have nothing to do with the earthquake -- hence the \texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION}.
For noise simulations, it is critical to have no earthquakes. In other words, the moment tensor
specified in \texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION} must be set to ZERO! \\

\texttt{DATA/STATIONS} remains the same as in previous earthquake simulations,
except that the order of stations listed in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS} is now important.
The order will be used later to identify the `master' receiver,
i.e., the one that simultaneously cross correlates with the others.
Please be noted that the actual station file used in the simulation is \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/STATIONS\_FILTERED},
which is generated when you run your simulations. (e.g., in regional simulations we may have included stations out of the
region of our interests in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS}, so we have to get rid of them.)\\

\texttt{DATA/Par\_file} also requires careful attention.
New to this version of SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE, a parameter called \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} has been added that specifies the type of simulation to be run.
\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} is an integer with possible values 0, 1, 2 and 3.
For example, when \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} equals 0, a regular earthquake simulation will be run.
When \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} is equal to 1/2/3, you are about to run
step 1/2/3 of the noise simulations respectively.
Should you be confused by the three steps, refer to \citet{trompetal2010} for details.\\

Another change to \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} involves the parameter \texttt{RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES}.
While for regular earthquake simulations this parameter specifies the length of synthetic seismograms generated,
for noise simulations it specifies the length of the seismograms used to compute cross correlations.
The actual cross correlations are thus twice this length.
The code automatically makes modification accordingly, if \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} is not zero.\\

There are other parameters in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} which should be given specific values.
For instance, \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_RUNS} and \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_THIS\_RUN} must be 1;
\texttt{ROTATE\_SEISMOGRAMS\_RT}, \texttt{SAVE\_ALL\_SEISMOGRAMS\_IN\_ONE\_FILES},
\texttt{USE\_BINARY\_FOR\_LARGE\_FILE} and \texttt{MOVIE\_COARSE} should be \texttt{.false.}.
Moreover, since the first two steps for calculating noise cross-correlation kernels correspond to
forward simulations, \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE} must be 1 when \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} equals 1 or 2.
Also, we have to reconstruct the ensemble forward wavefields in adjoint simulations,
therefore we need to set \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} to \texttt{.true.} for the second step,
i.e., when \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} equals 2.
The third step is for kernel constructions. Hence \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE} should be 3, whereas
\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} must be \texttt{.false.}.\\


\section{Noise Simulations: Step by Step}

Proper parameters in those `old' input files are not enough for noise simulations to run.
We have a lot more `new' input parameter files to specify:
for example, the ensemble-averaged noise spectrum, the noise distribution etc.
However, since there are a few `new' files, it is better to introduce them sequentially.
Read through this section even if you don't understand some parts temporarily,
since some examples you can go through are provided in this package.

\subsection{Pre-simulation}

\begin{itemize}

\item
As usual, we first configure the software package using:

\texttt{./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90} \\

\item
Next, we need to compile the source code using:

\texttt{make xmeshfem3D}

\texttt{make xspecfem3D} \\

Before compilation, the \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} must be specified correctly, e.g.,
\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} shouldn't be zero; \texttt{RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES},
\texttt{NEX\_XI} and \texttt{NEX\_ETA} must be what you want in your real simulations.
Otherwise you may get wrong informations which will cause problems later.
(it is good to always re-complie the code before you run simulations)\\

\item
After compiling, you will find two important numbers besides the needed executables:

\texttt{number of time steps = 31599}

\texttt{time\_stepping of the solver will be: 0.19000}\\

The first number will be denoted as \texttt{NSTEP} from now on, and the second one as \texttt{dt}.
The two numbers are essential to calculate the ensemble-averaged noise spectrum from either Peterson's noise
model or just a simple flat power spectrum (corresponding to 1-bit preprocessing).
Should you miss the two numbers, you can run
\texttt{./xcreate\_header\_file} to bring them up again (with correct \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}!).
FYI, \texttt{NSTEP} is determined by \texttt{RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES} in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file},
which is automatically doubled in noise simulations; whereas \texttt{dt} is derived from
\texttt{NEX\_XI} and \texttt{NEX\_ETA}, or in other words your element sizes.


\item
A Matlab script is provided to generate the ensemble-averaged noise spectrum.

\texttt{EXAMPLES/noise\_examples/NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY.m}  (main program)\\
\texttt{EXAMPLES/noise\_examples/PetersonNoiseModel.m}


In Matlab, simply run:

\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY(NSTEP, dt, Tmin, Tmax, NOISE\_MODEL)}\\

\texttt{NSTEP} and \texttt{dt} have been given when compiling the specfem3D source code;
\texttt{Tmin} and \texttt{Tmax} correspond to the period range you are interested in;
\texttt{NOISE\_MODEL} denotes the noise model you will be using.
Details can be found in the Matlab script.

After running the Matlab script, you will be given the following information (plus a figure in Matlab):

\texttt{*************************************************************}\\
\texttt{the source time function has been saved in:}\\
\texttt{/data2/yangl/3D\_NOISE/S\_squared} (note this path must be different)\\
\texttt{S\_squared should be put into directory:}\\
\texttt{./NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/ in the SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE package}\\

In other words, the Matlab script creates a file called \texttt{S\_squared},
which is the first `new' input file we encounter for noise simulations.

One may choose a flat noise spectrum rather than Peterson's noise model.
This can be done easily by modifying the Matlab script a little bit.

\item
Create a new directory in the SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE package, name it as \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY}.
In fact, this new directory should have been created already when checking out the package.
We will add/replace some information needed in this folder.

\item
Put the Matlab-generated-file \texttt{S\_squared} in \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY}.

That's to say, you will have a file \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/S\_squared} in the SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE package.

\item
Create a file called \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/irec\_master\_noise}. Note that this file should be put
in directory \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY} as well. This file contains only one integer, which is the ID
of the `master' receiver. For example, if in this file shows 5, it means that the fifth receiver
listed in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS} becomes the `master'. That's why we mentioned previously that
the order of receivers in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS} is important.

Note that in regional (1- or 2-chunk) simulations, the \texttt{DATA/STATIONS}
may contain receivers not within the selected chunk(s).
Therefore, the integer in \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/irec\_master\_noise}
is actually the ID in \texttt{DATA/STATIONS\_FILTERED} (which is generated by \texttt{xspecfem3D}).

\item
Create a file called \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/nu\_master}. This file holds three numbers,
forming a (unit) vector. It describes which component we are cross-correlating at the `master'
receiver, i.e., ${\hat{\bf \nu}}^{\alpha}$ in \citet{trompetal2010}. The three numbers correspond to
N/E/Z components respectively.

\item
Describe the noise direction and distributions in \texttt{src/specfem3d/noise\_tomography.f90}.
Search for a subroutine called \texttt{noise\_distribution\_direction}
in \texttt{noise\_tomography.f90}. It is actually located at the very beginning
of \texttt{noise\_tomography.f90}. The default assumes vertical noises and a uniform distribution
across the whole physical domain. It should be quite self-explanatory for modifications.
Should you modify this part, you have to re-compile the source code. (again, that's why we recommend
that you always re-compile the code before you run simulations)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulations}

As discussed in \citet{trompetal2010}, it takes three simulations to obtain one contribution
of the ensemble sensitivity kernels:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Step 1: simulation for generating wavefield\\
\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE=1}\\
\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY=1}\\
\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} not used, can be either .true. or .false.

\item
Step 2: simulation for ensemble forward wavefield\\
\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE=1}\\
\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY=2}\\
\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD=.true.}

\item
Step 3: simulation for ensemble adjoint wavefield and sensitivity kernels\\
\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE=3}\\
\texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY=3}\\
\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD=.false.}

Note Step 3 is an adjoint simulation, please refer to previous chapters on how to prepare adjoint sources
and other necessary files, as well as how adjoint simulations work.

\end{itemize}

It's better to run the three steps continuously within the same job, otherwise you have to collect the saved surface movies
from the old nodes to the new nodes.\\

\subsection{Post-simulation}

After those simulations, you have all stuff you need, either in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} or
in the directory specified by \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} (most probably on local nodes).
Collect whatever you want from the local nodes to your workstation, and then visualize them.
This process is the same as what you may have done for regular earthquake simulations.
Refer Chapter~\ref{cha:graphics} if you have problems.\\

Simply speaking, two outputs are the most interesting: the simulated ensemble cross correlations and
one contribution of the ensemble sensitivity kernels.\\

The simulated ensemble cross correlations are obtained after the second simulation (Step 2).
Seismograms in \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} are actually the simulated ensemble cross correlations.
Collect them immediately after Step 2, or the Step 3 will overwrite them.
Note that we have a `master' receiver specified by \texttt{NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY/irec\_master\_noise},
the seismogram at one station corresponds to the cross correlation between that station and the `master'.
Since the seismograms have three components, we may obtain cross correlations
for different components as well, not necessarily the cross correlations between vertical components.\\

One contribution of the ensemble cross-correlation sensitivity kernels are obtained after Step 3,
stored in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} on local nodes.
The ensemble kernel files are named the same as regular earthquake kernels.\\

You need to run another three simulations to get the other contribution of the ensemble kernels,
using different forward and adjoint sources given in \citet{trompetal2010}.

\section{Examples}

In order to illustrate noise simulations in an easy way, three examples are provided in
\texttt{EXAMPLES/noise\_examples/}.
Note however that they are created for a specific cluster (SESAME@PRINCETON).
You have to modify them to fit your own cluster.

The three examples can be executed using (in directory \texttt{EXAMPLES/noise\_examples/}):\\

\texttt{./pre-processing regional}

\texttt{./pre-processing global\_short}

\texttt{./pre-processing global\_long}\\

Each corresponds to one example, but they are pretty similar.

Although the job submission only works on SESAME@PRINCETON, the procedure itself is universal.
You may review the whole process described in the last section by following commands in those examples.

Finally, note again that those examples show only one contribution of the ensemble kernels!

\section{\label{sec:Meshes}Meshes}

Use the serial code \texttt{combine\_AVS\_DX.f90} (type `\texttt{make
combine\_AVS\_DX}' and then `\texttt{xcombine\_AVS\_DX}') to generate
AVS \urlwithparentheses{www.avs.com} output files (in AVS UCD format) or OpenDX \urlwithparentheses{www.opendx.org}
output files showing the mesh, the MPI partition (slices), the $\nchunks$
chunks, the source and receiver location, etc. Use the AVS UCD files
\texttt{AVS\_continent\_boundaries.inp} and \texttt{AVS\_plate\_boundaries.inp}
or the OpenDX files \texttt{DX\_continent\_boundaries.dx} and \texttt{DX\_plate\_boundaries.dx}
(that can be created using Perl scripts located in \texttt{UTILS/Visualization/opendx\_AVS})
for reference.


\section{\label{sec:Movies}Movies}

To make a surface or volume movie of the simulation, set parameters
\texttt{MOVIE\_SURFACE}, \texttt{MOVIE\_VOLUME}, and \texttt{NTSTEP\_BETWEEN\_FRAMES}
in the \texttt{Par\_file}. Turning on the movie flags, in particular
\texttt{MOVIE\_VOLUME}, produces large output files. \texttt{MOVIE\_VOLUME}
files are saved in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} directory, whereas \texttt{MOVIE\_SURFACE}
output files are saved in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory. We
save the velocity field. The look of a movie is determined by the
half-duration of the source. The half-duration should be large enough
so that the movie does not contain frequencies that are not resolved
by the mesh, i.e., it should not contain numerical noise. This can
be accomplished by selecting a CMT \texttt{HALF\_DURATION} > 1.1 $\times$
smallest period (see figure \ref{fig:CMTSOLUTION-file}). When \texttt{\small MOVIE\_SURFACE}
= \texttt{\small .true.} or \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME}{\small{}
}\texttt{\small =}{\small{} }\texttt{\small .true.}, the half duration
of each source in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file is replaced by

\begin{quote}
\[
\sqrt{(}\mathrm{\mathtt{HALF\_DURATIO}\mathtt{N}^{2}}+\mathrm{\mathtt{HDUR\_MOVI}\mathtt{E}^{2}})\]
\textbf{NOTE:} If \texttt{HDUR\_MOVIE} is set to 0.0, the code will
select the appropriate value of 1.1 $\times$ smallest period. As
usual, for a point source one can set \texttt{HALF\_DURATION} in the
\texttt{Par\_file} to be 0.0 and \texttt{HDUR\_MOVIE} = 0.0 to get
the highest frequencies resolved by the simulation, but for a finite
source one would keep all the \texttt{HALF\_DURATION}s as prescribed
by the finite source model and set \texttt{HDUR\_MOVIE} = 0.0.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Movie Surface}

When running \texttt{xspecfem3D} with the \texttt{MOVIE\_SURFACE}
flag turned on the code outputs \texttt{moviedata??????} files in
the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES} directory. The files are in a fairly complicated
binary format, but there are two programs provided to convert the
output into more user friendly formats. The first one, \texttt{create\_movie\_AVS\_DX.f90}
outputs data in ASCII, OpenDX, AVS, or ParaView format. Run the code
from the source directory (type `\texttt{make} \texttt{create\_movie\_AVS\_DX}'
first) to create an input file in your format of choice. The code
will prompt the user for input parameters. The second program \texttt{create\_movie\_GMT\_global.f90}
outputs ASCII xyz files, convenient for use with GMT. This codes uses
significantly less memory than \texttt{create\_movie\_AVS\_DX.f90}
and is therefore useful for high resolution runs.
A README file and sample Perl scripts to create movies using GMT are provided in directory
\texttt{UTILS/Visualization/GMT}.

earthquake. Time runs down successive columns.}

\end{figure}



\subsection{\label{sub:Movie-Volume}Movie Volume}

When running xspecfem3D with the \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME} flag
turned on, the code outputs several files in \texttt{\small LOCAL\_DIR}.
As the files can be very large, there are several flags in the \texttt{\small Par\_file}
that control the region in space and time that is saved. These are:
\texttt{\small MOVIE\_TOP\_KM}, \texttt{\small MOVIE\_BOTTOM\_KM},
\texttt{\small MOVIE\_WEST\_DEG}, \texttt{\small MOVIE\_EAST\_DEG},
\texttt{\small MOVIE\_NORTH\_DEG}, \texttt{\small MOVIE\_SOUTH\_DEG},
\texttt{\small MOVIE\_START} and \texttt{\small MOVIE\_STOP}. The
code will save a given element if the center of the element is in
the prescribed volume.

\begin{description}
\item [{The~Top/Bottom:}] Depth below the surface in kilometers, use \texttt{\small MOVIE\_TOP}
\texttt{\small =} \texttt{\small -100.0} to make sure the surface
is stored.
\item [{West/East:}] Longitude, degrees East {[}-180.0/180.0]
\item [{North/South:}] Latitute, degrees North {[}-90.0/90.0]
\item [{Start/Stop:}] Frames will be stored at \texttt{\small MOVIE\_START}
\texttt{\small +} \texttt{\small i{*}NSTEP\_BETWEEN\_FRAMES}, where
\texttt{\small i=(0,1,2..)} while \texttt{\small i{*}NSTEP\_BETWEEN\_FRAMES}
\texttt{\small <=} \texttt{\small MOVIE\_STOP}{\small \par}
\end{description}
The code saves several files, and the output is saved by each processor.
The first is \texttt{\small proc??????\_movie3D\_info.txt} which contains
two numbers, first the number of points within the prescribed volume
within this particular slice, and second the number of elements. The
next files are \texttt{\small proc??????\_movie3D\_x.bin}, \texttt{\small proc??????\_movie3D\_y.bin},
\texttt{\small proc??????\_movie3D\_z.bin} which store the locations
of the points in the 3D mesh.

Finally the code stores the ``value'' at each of the points. Which
value is determined by \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE} in the
\texttt{\small Par\_file}. Choose 1 to save the strain, 2 to save
the time integral of strain, and 3 to save $\mu${*}time integral
of strain in the subvolume. Choosing 4 causes the code to save the
trace of the stress and the deviatoric stress in the whole volume
(not the subvolume in space), at the time steps specified. The name
of the output file will depend on the \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE}
chosen.

Setting \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_COARSE} \texttt{\small =} \texttt{\small .true.}
will make the code save only the corners of the elements, not all
the points within each element for \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE}
\texttt{\small =} \texttt{\small 1,2,3}.

To make the code output your favorite ``value'' simply add a new \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE},
a new subroutine to \texttt{\small write\_movie\_volume.f90} and a
subroutine call to \texttt{\small specfem3D.F90}.

A utility program to combine the files produced by \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE}
\texttt{\small =} \texttt{\small 1,2,3} is provided in \texttt{\small combine\_paraview}~\\
\texttt{\small \_strain\_data.f90}. Type \texttt{\small xcombine\_paraview\_strain\_data}
to get the usage statement. The program \texttt{\small combine\_vol}~\\
\texttt{\small \_data.f90} can be used for \texttt{\small MOVIE\_VOLUME\_TYPE}
\texttt{\small =} \texttt{\small 4}.


\section{\label{sec:Finite-Frequency-Kernels}Finite-Frequency Kernels}

The finite-frequency kernels computed as explained in Section \ref{sec:Adjoint-simulation-finite}
are saved in the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH} at the end of the simulation.
Therefore, we first need to collect these files on the front end,
combine them into one mesh file, and visualize them with some auxilliary
programs. Examples of kernel simulations may be found in the \texttt{EXAMPLES} directory.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create slice files}


We will only discuss the case of one source-receiver pair, i.e., the
so-called banana-doughnut kernels. Although it is possible to collect
the kernel files from all slices onto the front end, it usually takes
up too much storage space (at least tens of gigabytes). Since the
sensitivity kernels are the strongest along the source-receiver great
circle path, it is sufficient to collect only the slices that are
along or close to the great circle path.

A Perl script \texttt{UTILS/Visualization/Paraview/global\_slice\_number.pl} can
help to figure out the slice numbers that lie along the great circle
path (both the minor and major arcs), as well as the slice numbers
required to produce a full picture of the inner core if your kernel
also illuminates the inner core.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You need to first compile the utility programs provided in the \texttt{UTILS/Visualization/Paraview/}~\\
\texttt{global\_slice\_util
}directory. Then copy the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, \texttt{STATIONS\_ADJOINT},
and \texttt{Par\_file}, and run:

\begin{lyxcode}
global\_slice\_number.pl~CMTSOLUTION~STATIONS\_ADJOINT~Par\_file
\end{lyxcode}
In the case of visualization boundary kernels or spherical cross-sections
of the volumetric kernels, it is necessary to obtain the slice numbers
that cover a belt along the source and receiver great circle path,
and you can use the hybrid version:

\begin{lyxcode}
globe\_slice\_number2.pl~CMTSOLUTION~STATIONS\_ADJOINT~

~~~~~Par\_file~belt\_width\_in\_degrees
\end{lyxcode}
A typical value for \texttt{belt\_width\_in\_degrees} can be 20.

\item For a full 6-chunk simulation, this script will generate the \texttt{slice\_minor},
\texttt{slice\_major}, \texttt{slice\_ic} files, but for a one- or
two-chunk simulation, this script only generates the \texttt{slice\_minor}
file.
\item For cases with multiple sources and multiple receivers, you need to
provide a slice file before proceeding to the next step.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Collect the kernel files}


After obtaining the slice files, you can collect the corresponding
kernel files from the given slices.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To accomplish this, you can use or modify the scripts in \texttt{UTILS/collect\_database
}directory:

\begin{lyxcode}
{\small copy\_m(oc,ic)\_globe\_database.pl~slice\_file~lsf\_machine\_file~filename~{[}jobid]}{\small \par}
\end{lyxcode}
for volumetric kernels, where \texttt{\small lsf\_machine\_file} is
the machine file generated by the LSF scheduler, \texttt{\small filename}
is the kernel name (e.g., \texttt{\small rho\_kernel}, \texttt{\small alpha\_kernel}
and \texttt{\small beta\_kernel}), and the optional \texttt{\small jobid}
is the name of the subdirectory under \texttt{\small LOCAL\_PATH}
where all the kernel files are stored. For boundary kernels, you need
to use

\begin{lyxcode}
{\small copy\_surf\_globe\_database.pl~slice\_file~lsf\_machine\_file~filename~{[}jobid]}{\small \par}
\end{lyxcode}
where the filename can be \texttt{\small Moho\_kernel}, \texttt{\small d400\_kernel},
\texttt{\small d670\_kernel}, \texttt{\small CMB\_kernel} and \texttt{\small ICB\_kernel}.

\item After executing this script, all the necessary mesh topology files
as well as the kernel array files are collected to the local directory
on the front end.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Combine kernel files into one mesh file}


We use an auxiliary program \texttt{combine\_vol\_data.f90} to combine
the volumetric kernel files from all slices into one mesh file, and
\texttt{combine\_surf\_data.f90 }to combine the surface kernel files.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile it in the global code directory:

\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize make~combine\_vol\_data~}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize ./bin/xcombine\_vol\_data}~{\footnotesize slice\_list}~{\footnotesize kernel\_filename}~
{\footnotesize input\_topo\_dir}~
{\footnotesize input\_file\_dir}~{\footnotesize output\_dir}

{\footnotesize low/high-resolution-flag-0-or-1}~{\footnotesize {[}region]}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
where \texttt{input\_dir} is the directory where all the individual
kernel files are stored, and \texttt{output\_dir} is where the mesh
file will be written. Give 0 for low resolution and 1 for high resolution.
If region is not specified, all three regions (crust and mantle, outer core, inner core)
will be collected, otherwise, only the specified region will be.
Here is an example: 
\texttt{./xcombine\_vol\_data slices\_major alpha\_kernel input\_topo\_dir}
\texttt{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~input\_file\_dir output\_dir 1}

\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize ./bin/xcombine\_surf\_data~slice\_list~filename~surfname~input\_dir~output\_dir}
{\footnotesize ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~low/high-resolution~2D/3D}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
where \texttt{surfname} should correspond to the specific kernel file
name, and can be chosen from \texttt{Moho}, \texttt{400}, \texttt{670},
\texttt{CMB} and \texttt{ICB}.

\item Use 1 for a high-resolution mesh, outputting all the GLL points to
the mesh file, or use 0 for low resolution, outputting only the corner
points of the elements to the mesh file. Use 0 for 2D surface kernel
files and 1 for 3D volumetric kernel files.
\item Use region = 1 for the mantle, region =2 for the outer core, region
= 3 for the inner core, and region = 0 for all regions.
\item The output mesh file will have the name \texttt{reg\_?\_rho(alpha,beta)\_kernel.mesh,}
or\texttt{ }~\\
\texttt{reg\_?\_Moho(d400,d670,CMB,ICB)\_kernel.surf.}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Convert mesh files into .vtu files}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We next convert the \texttt{.mesh} file into the VTU (Unstructured
grid file) format which can be viewed in ParaView, for example:

\begin{lyxcode}
mesh2vtu~-i~file.mesh~-o~file.vtu
\end{lyxcode}
\item Notice that this program \texttt{mesh2vtu}, in the
\texttt{UTILS/Visualization/Paraview/mesh2vtu} directory, uses the
VTK \urlwithparentheses{www.vtk.org} run-time library for its execution. Therefore,
make sure you have it properly installed.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Copy over the source and receiver .vtk file}


In the case of a single source and a single receiver, the simulation
also generates the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/sr.vtk} file to describe
the source and receiver locations, which can be viewed in Paraview
in the next step.

\item \textbf{View the mesh in ParaView}


Finally, we can view the mesh in ParaView \urlwithparentheses{www.paraview.org}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open ParaView.
\item From the top menu, \textsf{File} $\rightarrow$\textsf{ Open data},
select \texttt{file.vtu}, and click the \textsf{Accept} button.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the mesh file is of moderate size, it shows up on the screen; otherwise,
only the outline is shown.
\end{itemize}
\item Click \textsf{Display Tab} $\rightarrow$ \textsf{Display Style} $\rightarrow$
\textsf{Representation} and select \textsf{wireframe of surface} to
display it.
\item To create a cross-section of the volumetric mesh, choose \textsf{Filter}
$\rightarrow$ \textsf{cut}, and under \textsf{Parameters Tab}, choose
\textsf{Cut Function} $\rightarrow$ \textsf{plane}.
\item Fill in center and normal information given by the standard output
from \texttt{global\_slice\_number.pl} script.
\item To change the color scale, go to \textsf{Display Tab} $\rightarrow$
\textsf{Color} $\rightarrow$ \textsf{Edit Color Map} and reselect
lower and upper limits, or change the color scheme.
\item Now load in the source and receiver location file by \textsf{File}
$\rightarrow$\textsf{ Open data}, select \texttt{sr.vt}k, and click
the \textsf{Accept} button. Choose \textsf{Filter} $\rightarrow$\textsf{
Glyph}, and represent the points by `\textsf{spheres}'.
\item For more information about ParaView, see the ParaView Users Guide \urlwithparentheses{www.paraview.org/files/v1.6/ParaViewUsersGuide.PDF}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
For illustration purposes, Figure \ref{fig:P-wave-speed-finite-frequency}
shows P-wave speed finite-frequency kernels from cross-correlation traveltime and amplitude measurements for a P arrival recorded at an epicentral distance of $60^{\circ}$ for a deep event.

\chapter{\label{cha:Running-Scheduler}Running through a Scheduler}

The code is usually run on large parallel machines, often PC clusters,
most of which use schedulers, i.e., queuing or batch management systems
to manage the running of jobs from a large number of users. The following
considerations need to be taken into account when running on a system
that uses a scheduler:

\begin{itemize}
\item The processors/nodes to be used for each run are assigned dynamically
by the scheduler, based on availability. Therefore, in order for the
mesher and the solver (or between successive runs of the solver) to
have access to the same database files (if they are stored on hard
drives local to the nodes on which the code is run), they must be
launched in sequence as a single job.
\item On some systems, the nodes to which running jobs are assigned are
not configured for compilation. It may therefore be necessary to pre-compile
both the mesher and the solver. A small program provided in the distribution
called \texttt{\small create\_header\_file.f90} can be used to directly
create\texttt{\small{} OUTPUT\_FILES/values\_from\_mesher.h} using
the information in the \texttt{\small DATA/Par\_file} without having
to run the mesher (type \texttt{\small `make}{\small{} }\texttt{\small create\_header\_}~\\
\texttt{\small file}' to compile it and `\texttt{\small ./bin/xcreate\_header\_file}'
to run it; refer to the sample scripts below). The solver can now
be compiled as explained above.
\item One feature of schedulers/queuing systems is that they allow submission
of multiple jobs in a {}``launch and forget'' mode. In order to
take advantage of this property, care needs to be taken that output
and intermediate files from separate jobs do not overwrite each other,
or otherwise interfere with other running jobs.
\end{itemize}
We describe here in some detail a job submission procedure for the
Caltech 1024-node cluster, CITerra, under the LSF scheduling system.
We consider the submission of a regular forward simulation. The two
main scripts are \texttt{\small run\_lsf.bash}, which compiles the
Fortran code and submits the job to the scheduler, and \texttt{\small go\_mesher\_solver\_lsf}~\\
\texttt{\small .bash}, which contains the instructions that make up
the job itself. These scripts can be found in \texttt{\small UTILS/Cluster/lsf}
directory and can straightforwardly be modified and adapted to meet
more specific running needs.


\section{\texttt{run\_lsf.bash}}

This script first sets the job queue to be `normal'. It then compiles
the mesher and solver together, figures out the number of processors
required for this simulation from \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}, and submits
the LSF job.

\begin{lyxcode}

\section{\texttt{go\_mesher\_solver\_lsf\_globe.bash}}

This script describes the job itself, including setup steps that can
only be done once the scheduler has assigned a job-ID and a set of
compute nodes to the job, the \texttt{run\_lsf.bash} commands used
to run the mesher and the solver, and calls to scripts that collect
the output seismograms from the compute nodes and perform clean-up
operations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First the script directs the scheduler to save its own output and
output from \texttt{stdout} into \texttt{\small OUTPUT\_FILES/\%J.o},
where \texttt{\%J} is short-hand for the job-ID; it also tells the
scheduler what version of \texttt{mpich} to use (\texttt{mpich\_gm})
and how to name this job (\texttt{go\_mesher\_solver\_lsf}).
\item The script then creates a list of the nodes allocated to this job
by echoing the value of a dynamically set environment variable \texttt{LSB\_MCPU\_HOSTS}
and parsing the output into a one-column list using the Perl script
\texttt{UTILS/Cluster/lsf/remap\_lsf\_machines.pl}. It then creates a set of scratch
directories on these nodes (\texttt{\small /scratch/}~\\
\texttt{\small \$USER/DATABASES\_MPI}) to be used as the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}
for temporary storage of the database files. The scratch directories
are created using \texttt{shmux}, a shell multiplexor that can execute
the same commands on many hosts in parallel. \texttt{shmux} is available
from Shmux \urlwithparentheses{web.taranis.org/shmux/}. Make sure that the \texttt{LOCAL\_PATH}
parameter in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} is also set properly.
\item The next portion of the script launches the mesher and then the solver
using \texttt{run\_lsf.bash}.
\item The final portion of the script performs clean up on the nodes using
the Perl script \texttt{cleanmulti.pl}

\section{\texttt{run\_lsf.kernel} and \texttt{go\_mesher\_solver\_globe.kernel}}

For kernel simulations, you can use the sample run scripts \texttt{run\_lsf.kernel}
and \texttt{go\_mesher\_solver\_globe}~\\
\texttt{.kernel} provided in \texttt{UTILS/Cluster} directory, and modify
the command-line arguments of \texttt{xcreate\_adjsrc\_traveltime} in
\texttt{go\_mesher\_solver\_globe.kernel} according to the start and end time
of the specific portion of the forward seismograms you are interested
in.


\chapter{{\normalsize \label{cha:-Changing-the}} Changing the Model}

In this section we explain how to change the crustal, mantle, or inner
core models. These changes involve contributing specific subroutines
that replace existing subroutines in the \texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE}
package.


\section{{\normalsize \label{sec:Changing-the-Crustal}}Changing the Crustal
Model}

The 3D crustal model Crust2.0 \citep{BaLaMa00} is superimposed onto
the mesh by the subroutine \texttt{model\_crust}~\\
\texttt{.f90}. To accomplish this, the flag \texttt{CRUSTAL}, set
in the subroutine \texttt{get\_model\_parameters.f90}, is used
to indicate a 3D crustal model. When this flag is set to \texttt{.true.},
the crust on top of the 1D reference model (PREM, IASP91, or AK135F\_NO\_MUD)
is removed and replaced by extending the mantle. The 3D crustal model
is subsequently overprinted onto the crust-less 1D reference model.
The call to the 3D crustal routine is of the form

\begin{lyxcode}
call~model\_crust(lat,lon,r,vp,vs,rho,moho,foundcrust,CM\_V,elem\_in\_crust)
\end{lyxcode}
Input to this routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{lat}}] Latitude in degrees.
\item [{\texttt{lon}}] Longitude in degrees.
\item [{\texttt{r}}] Non-dimensionalized radius ($0<\texttt{r}<1$).
\end{description}
Output from the routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{vp}}] Non-dimensionalized compressional wave speed at location
(\texttt{lat},\texttt{lon},\texttt{r}).
\item [{\texttt{vs}}] Non-dimensionalized shear wave speed.
\item [{\texttt{rho}}] Non-dimensionalized density.
\item [{\texttt{moho}}] Non-dimensionalized Moho depth.
\item [{\texttt{found\_crust}}] Logical that is set to \texttt{.true.}
only if crust exists at location (\texttt{lat},\texttt{lon},\texttt{r}),
i.e., \texttt{.false.} for radii \texttt{r} in the mantle. This flags
determines whether or not a particular location is in the crust and,
if so, what parameters to assign to the mesh at this location.
\item [{\texttt{CM\_V}}] Fortran structure that contains the parameters,
variables and arrays that describe the model.
\item [{\texttt{elem\_in\_crust}}] Logical that is used to force the
routine to return crustal values, even if the location would
be below the crust.
\end{description}
All output needs to be non-dimensionalized according to the convention
summarized in Appendix~\ref{cha:Non-Dimensionalization-Conventions}.
You can replace this subroutine by your own routine \textit{provided
you do not change the call structure of the routine}, i.e., the new
routine should take exactly the same input and produce the required,
properly non-dimensionalized output.

Part of the file \texttt{model\_crust.f90} is the subroutine \texttt{model\_crust\_broadcast}.
The call to this routine takes argument \texttt{CM\_V} and is used
to once-and-for-all read in the databases related to Crust2.0 and
broadcast the model to all parallel processes. If
you replace the file \texttt{model\_crust.f90} with your own implementation,
you \textit{must} provide a \texttt{model\_crust\_broadcast} routine,
even if it does nothing. Model constants and variables read by the
routine \texttt{model\_crust\_broadcast} are passed to the subroutine
\texttt{read\_crust\_model} through the structure \texttt{CM\_V}.
An alternative crustal model could use the same construct. Please
feel free to contribute subroutines for new models and send them to
us so that they can be included in future releases of the software.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{NOTE:} If you decide to create your own version of file \texttt{model\_crust.f90},
you must add calls to \texttt{MPI\_BCAST} in the subroutine \texttt{model\_crust\_broadcast}
after the call to the \texttt{read\_crust\_model} subroutine that
reads the isotropic mantle model once and for all in the mesher. This
is done in order to read the (potentially large) model data files
on the master node (which is the processor of rank 0 in our code)
only and then send a copy to all the other nodes using an MPI broadcast,
rather than using an implementation in which all the nodes would read
the same model data files from a remotely-mounted home file system,
which could create a bottleneck on the network in the case of a large
number of nodes. For example, in the current call to that routine
from \texttt{model\_crust.f90,} we write:
\end{quote}

\end{lyxcode}

\section{{\normalsize \label{sec:Changing-the-Mantle}}Changing the Mantle
Model}

This section discusses how to change isotropic and anisotropic 3D
mantle models. Usually such changes go hand-in-hand with changing
the 3D crustal model.


\subsection{{\normalsize \label{sub:Isotropic-Models}Isotropic Models}}

The 3D mantle model S20RTS \citep{RiVaWo99} is superimposed onto
the mantle mesh by the subroutine \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90}. The
call to this subroutine is of the form

\begin{lyxcode}
call~model\_s20rts(radius,theta,phi,dvs,dvp,drho,D3MM\_V)~
\end{lyxcode}
Input to this routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{radius}}] Non-dimensionalized radius ($\texttt{RCMB/R\_ EARTH}<\texttt{r}<\texttt{RMOHO/R\_ EARTH}$;
for a given 1D reference model, the constants \texttt{RCMB} and \texttt{RMOHO}
are set in the \texttt{\small get\_model\_parameters}\texttt{.f90}
file). The code expects the isotropic mantle model to be defined between
the Moho (with radius \texttt{RMOHO} in m) and the core-mantle boundary
(CMB; radius \texttt{RCMB} in m) of a 1D reference model. When a 3D
crustal model is superimposed, as will usually be the case, the 3D
mantle model is stretched to fill any potential gap between the radius
of the Moho in the 1D reference model and the Moho in the 3D crustal
model. Thus, when the Moho in the 3D crustal model is shallower than
the Moho in the reference model, e.g., typically below the oceans,
the mantle model is extended to fill this gap.
\item [{\texttt{theta}}] Colatitude in radians.
\item [{\texttt{phi}}] Longitude in radians.
\end{description}
Output from the routine are the following non-dimensional perturbations:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{dvs}}] Relative shear-wave speed perturbations $\delta\beta/\beta$
at location (\texttt{radius},\texttt{theta},\texttt{phi}).
\item [{\texttt{dvp}}] Relative compressional-wave speed perturbations
$\delta\alpha/\alpha$.
\item [{\texttt{drho}}] Relative density perturbations $\delta\rho/\rho$.
\item [{\texttt{D3MM\_V}}] Fortran structure that contains the parameters,
variables and arrays that describe the model.
\end{description}
You can replace the \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90} file with your own
version \textit{provided you do not change the call structure of the
routine}, i.e., the new routine should take exactly the same input
and produce the required relative output.

Part of the file \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90} is the subroutine
\texttt{model\_s20rts\_broadcast}.
The call to this routine takes argument\texttt{ D3MM\_V} and is used
to once-and-for-all read in the databases related to S20RTS. If you
replace the file \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90} with your own implementation,
you \textit{must} provide a \texttt{model\_s20rts\_broadcast} routine,
even if it does nothing. Model constants and variables read by the
routine \texttt{model\_s20rts\_broadcast} are passed to the subroutine
\texttt{read\_model\_s20rts} through the structure \texttt{D3MM\_V.}
An alternative mantle model should use the same construct.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{NOTE:} If you decide to create your own version of file \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90},
you must add calls to \texttt{MPI\_BCAST} in the subroutine \texttt{model\_s20rts\_broadcast}
after the call to the \texttt{read\_model\_s20rts} subroutine that
reads the isotropic mantle model once and for all in the mesher. This
is done in order to read the (potentially large) model data files
on the master node (which is the processor of rank 0 in our code)
only and then send a copy to all the other nodes using an MPI broadcast,
rather than using an implementation in which all the nodes would read
the same model data files from a remotely-mounted home file system,
which could create a bottleneck on the network in the case of a large
number of nodes. For example, in the current call to that routine
from \texttt{model\_s20rts.f90,} we write:

{\footnotesize{}~~call~MPI\_BCAST(D3MM\_V\%qq,3{*}(NK+1){*}(NK+1),MPI\_DOUBLE\_PRECISION,0,MPI\_COMM\_WORLD,ier)~}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}

\subsection{{\normalsize \label{sub:Anisotropic-Models}Anisotropic Models}}

Three-dimensional anisotropic mantle models may be superimposed on
the mesh based upon the subroutine

\begin{lyxcode}
model\_aniso\_mantle.f90
\end{lyxcode}
The call to this subroutine is of the form

\begin{lyxcode}
call~model\_aniso\_mantle(r,theta,phi,rho,~\&~

~~~~c11,c12,c13,c14,c15,c16,c22,c23,c24,c25,c26,~\&~

~~~~c33,c34,c35,c36,c44,c45,c46,c55,c56,c66,AMM\_V)~
\end{lyxcode}
Input to this routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{r}}] Non-dimensionalized radius ($\texttt{RCMB/R\_ EARTH}<\texttt{r}<\texttt{RMOHO/R\_ EARTH}$;
for a given 1D reference model, the constants \texttt{RCMB} and \texttt{RMOHO}
are set in the \texttt{\small get\_model\_parameters}\texttt{.f90}
file). The code expects the anisotropic mantle model to be defined
between the Moho and the core-mantle boundary (CMB). When a 3D crustal
model is superimposed, as will usually be the case, the 3D mantle
model is stretched to fill any potential gap between the radius of
the Moho in the 1D reference model and the Moho in the 3D crustal
model. Thus, when the Moho in the 3D crustal model is shallower than
the Moho in the reference model, e.g., typically below the oceans,
the mantle model is extended to fill this gap.
\item [{\texttt{theta}}] Colatitude in radians.
\item [{\texttt{phi}}] Longitude in radians.
\end{description}
Output from the routine consists of the following non-dimensional
model parameters:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{rho}}] Non-dimensionalized density $\rho$.
\item [{\texttt{c11},}] \textbf{$\cdots$,} \texttt{\textbf{c66}} 21 non-dimensionalized
anisotropic elastic parameters.
\item [{\texttt{AMM\_V}}] Fortran structure that contains the parameters,
variables and arrays that describe the model.
\end{description}
You can replace the \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90} file by
your own version \textit{provided you do not change the call structure
of the routine}, i.e., the new routine should take exactly the same
input and produce the required relative output. Part of the file \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90}
is the subroutine \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle\_broadcast}. The call to
this routine takes argument \texttt{AMM\_V} and is used to once-and-for-all
read in the static databases related to the anisotropic model. When
you choose to replace the file \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90}
with your own implementation you \textit{must} provide a \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle\_broadcast}
routine, even if it does nothing. Model constants and variables read
by the routine \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle\_broadcast} are passed through the
structure \texttt{AMM\_V}. An alternative anisotropic mantle model
should use the same construct.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{NOTE:} If you decide to create your own version of file \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90},
you must add calls to \texttt{MPI\_BCAST} in file \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90}
after the call to the \texttt{read\_aniso\_mantle\_model} subroutine
that reads the anisotropic mantle model once and for all in the mesher.
This is done in order to read the (potentially large) model data files
on the master node (which is the processor of rank 0 in our code)
only and then send a copy to all the other nodes using an MPI broadcast,
rather than using an implementation in which all the nodes would read
the same model data files from a remotely-mounted home file system,
which could create a bottleneck on the network in the case of a large
number of nodes. For example, in the current call to that routine
from \texttt{model\_aniso\_mantle.f90,} we write:
\end{quote}
\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize !~the~variables~read~are~declared~and~stored~in~structure~AMM\_V}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize{}~~if(myrank~==~0)~call~read\_aniso\_mantle\_model(AMM\_V)}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize !~broadcast~the~information~read~on~the~master~to~the~nodes}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize{}~~call~MPI\_BCAST(AMM\_V\%npar1,1,MPI\_INTEGER,0,MPI\_COMM\_WORLD,ier)~~~~}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize{}~~call~MPI\_BCAST(AMM\_V\%beta,14{*}34{*}37{*}73,MPI\_DOUBLE\_PRECISION,0,MPI\_COMM\_WORLD,ier)}{\footnotesize \par}

{\footnotesize{}~~call~MPI\_BCAST(AMM\_V\%pro,47,MPI\_DOUBLE\_PRECISION,0,MPI\_COMM\_WORLD,ier)}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
Rotation of the anisotropic tensor elements from one coordinate system
to another coordinate system may be accomplished based upon the subroutine
\texttt{rotate\_aniso\_tensor}. Use of this routine requires understanding
the coordinate system used in \texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE}, as discussed
in Appendix~\ref{cha:Reference-Frame-Convention}.


\subsection{{\normalsize \label{sub:Point-Profile-Models}Point-Profile Models}}

In order to facilitate the use of your own specific mantle model, you can choose \texttt{PPM} as model in the \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} file
and supply your own model as an ASCII-table file. These generic models are given as depth profiles at a specified lon/lat location
and a perturbation (in percentage) with respect to the shear-wave speed values from PREM. The ASCII-file should have a format like:
\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize \#lon(deg), lat(deg), depth(km), Vs-perturbation wrt PREM(\%), Vs-PREM (km/s)}{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize -10.00000       31.00000       40.00000      -1.775005       4.400000}{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize -10.00000       32.00000       40.00000      -1.056823       4.400000}{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize ...}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
where the first line is a comment line and all following ones are specifying the Vs-perturbation at a lon/lat location and a given depth.
The last entry on each line is specifying the absolute value of Vs (however this value is only given as a supplementary information
and not used any further). The background model is PREM with a transverse isotropic layer between Moho and 220~km depth.
The specified Vs-perturbations are added as isotropic perturbations. Please see the file \texttt{DATA/PPM/README}
for more informations how to setup the directory \texttt{DATA/PPM} to use your own ASCII-file.



To change the code behavior of these PPM-routines, please have a look at the implementation in the source code
file \texttt{model\_ppm.f90} and set the flags and scaling factors as needed for your purposes.
Perturbations in density and Vp may be scaled to the given Vs-perturbations with constant scaling factors by setting the appropriate
values in this source code file. In case you want to change the format of the input ASCII-file, see more details in the Appendix \ref{cha:Troubleshooting}.




\section{{\normalsize \label{sec:Anelastic-Models}}Anelastic Models}

Three-dimensional anelastic (attenuation) models may be superimposed
onto the mesh based upon your subroutine .
\texttt{model\_atten3D.f90}.
The call to this routine would be as follows

\begin{lyxcode}
call~model\_atten3D(radius,~colatitude,~longitude,~Qmu,~QRFSI12\_Q,~idoubling)
\end{lyxcode}
Input to this routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{radius}}] scaled radius of the earth: $0\,(\mathrm{center})<=r\,<=1$(surface)
\item [{\texttt{latitude}}] Colatitude in degrees: $0^{\circ}<=\theta<=180^{\circ}$
\item [{\texttt{longitude}}] Longitude in degrees: $-180^{\circ}<=\phi<=180^{\circ}$
\item [{\texttt{QRFSI12\_Q}}] Fortran structure that contains the parameters,
variables and arrays that describe the model
\item [{\texttt{idoubling}}] value of the doubling index flag in each radial region of the mesh
\end{description}
Output to this routine consists of:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{Qmu}}] Shear wave quality factor: $0<Q_{\mu}<5000$
\end{description}
A 3-D attenuation model QRFSI12 \citep{DaEkDz08}
is provided, as well as 1-D models with a PREM and a 1DREF
attenuation structure. By default the PREM attenuation model is taken,
using the routine \texttt{model\_attenuation\_1D\_PREM},
found in \texttt{model\_attenuation.f90}.

To create your own three-dimensional attenuation model, you add your model
using a routine like the ~\\
\texttt{model\_atten3D\_QRFSI12} subroutine
and the example routine above as a guide and replace the call in file
\texttt{meshfem3D\_models.f90} to your own subroutine.

Note that the resolution and maximum value of anelastic models are
truncated. This speeds the construction of the standard linear solids
during the meshing stage. To change the resolution, currently at one
significant figure following the decimal, or the maximum value (5000),
consult \texttt{constants.h}. In order to prevent unexpected results,
quality factors $Q_{\mu}$ should never be equal to 0 outside of the
inner core.


\chapter{Post-Processing Scripts}

Several post-processing scripts/programs are provided in the \texttt{UTILS/seis\_process}
directory, most of which need to be adjusted for different
systems, for example, the path of the executable programs. Here we
only list the available scripts and provide a brief description, and
you can either refer to the related sections for detailed usage or,
in many cases, type the script/program name without arguments
to see its usage.


\section{Clean Local Database}

After all the simulations are done, you may need to clean the local
scratch disks for the next simulation. This is especially important
in the case of 1- or 2-chunk kernel simulations, where very large files
are generated for the absorbing boundaries to help with the reconstruction
of the regular forward wavefield. A sample script is provided in \texttt{UTILS/Cluster/lsf}:

\begin{lyxcode}
cleanbase.pl~machines
\end{lyxcode}

\section{Process Data and Synthetics\label{sec:Process-data-and-syn}}

In many cases, the SEM synthetics are calculated and compared to observed
seismograms recorded at seismic stations. Since the SEM synthetics
are accurate for a certain frequency range, both the original data
and the synthetics need to be processed before a comparison can be
made. For such comparisons, the following steps are recommended:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure that both synthetic and observed seismograms have the correct station/event and timing information.
\item Convolve synthetic seismograms with a source time function with the half duration specified in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, provided, as recommended, you used a zero half duration in the SEM simulations.
\item Resample both observed and synthetic seismograms to a common sampling rate.
\item Cut the records using the same window.
\item Remove the trend and mean from the records and taper them.
\item Remove the instrument response from the observed seismograms (recommended) or convolve the synthetic seismograms with the instrument response.
\item Make sure that you apply the same filters to both observed and synthetic seismograms. Preferably, avoid filtering your records more than once.
\item Now, you are ready to compare your synthetic and observed seismograms.
\end{enumerate}

We generally use the following scripts for processing:

\subsection{\texttt{process\_data.pl}}

This script cuts a given portion of the original data, filters it,
transfers the data into a displacement record, and picks the first
P and S arrivals. For more functionality, type `\texttt{process\_data.pl}'
without any argument. An example of the usage of the script:

\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize process\_data.pl~-m~CMTSOLUTION~-s~1.0~-l~0/4000~-i~-f~-t~40/500~-p~-x~bp~DATA/1999.330{*}.LH?.SAC}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}

\noindent which has resampled the SAC files to a sampling rate of 1 seconds, cut them between 0 and 4000 seconds, transfered them into displacement
records and filtered them between 40 and 500 seconds, picked the first P and S arrivals, and added suffix `\texttt{bp}' to the file names.

Note that all of the scripts in this section actually use SAC,
saclst and/or IASP91 to do the core operations; therefore make sure
that the SAC, saclst and IASP91 packages are installed on your
system, and that all the environment variables are set properly before
running these scripts.


\subsection{\texttt{\label{sub:process_syn.pl}process\_syn.pl}}

This script converts the synthetic output from the SEM code from ASCII
to SAC format, and performs similar operations as `\texttt{process\_data.pl}'.
An example of the usage of the script:

\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize process\_syn.pl~-m~CMTSOLUTION~-h~-a~STATIONS~-s~1.0~-l~0/4000~-f~-t~40/500~-p~-x~bp~SEM/{*}.MX?.sem}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
which will convolve the synthetics with a triangular source-time function
from the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, convert the synthetics into SAC
format, add event and station information into the SAC headers, resample the SAC files with a sampling rate of 1 seconds, cut them between 0 and 4000 seconds, filter them between 40 and
500 seconds with the same filter used for the observed data, pick the first P and S arrivals, and add the suffix `\texttt{bp}'
to the file names.

More options are available for this script, such as adding a time shift
to the origin time of the synthetics, convolving the synthetics with
a triangular source time function with a given half duration, etc.
Type \texttt{process\_syn.pl} without any argument for detailed
usage.


\subsection{\texttt{rotate.pl}}

To rotate the horizontal components of both the data and the synthetics
(i.e., \texttt{MXN} and \texttt{MXE}) to the transverse and radial directions (i.e., \texttt{MXT} and \texttt{MXR}),\texttt{\small{}
}use{\small{} }\texttt{\small rotate.pl}:

\begin{lyxcode}
rotate.pl~-l~0~-L~4000~-d~DATA/{*}.LHE.SAC.bp~

rotate.pl~-l~0~-L~4000~SEM/{*}.MXE.sem.sac.bp~
\end{lyxcode}
where the first command performs rotation on the SAC data obtained
through IRIS (which may have timing information written in the filename),
while the second command rotates the processed synthetics.

For synthetics, another (simpler) option is to set flag \texttt{ROTATE\_SEISMOGRAMS\_RT}
to \texttt{.true.} in the parameter file \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}.


\subsection{\texttt{clean\_sac\_headers\_after\_crash.sh}}

Note: You need to have the \texttt{sismoutil-0.9b} package installed
on your computer if you want to run this script on binary SAC files.
The software is available via the ORFEUS web site \urlwithparentheses{www.orfeus-eu.org}.

In case the simulation crashes during run-time without computing and
writing all time steps, the SAC files (if flags \texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_ALPHANUM}
or \texttt{OUTPUT\_SEISMOS\_SAC\_BINARY} have been set to \texttt{.true.})
are corrupted and cannot be used in SAC. If the simulation
ran long enough so that the synthetic data may still be of use, you
can run the script called \texttt{clean\_sac\_headers\_after\_crash.sh}
(located in the \texttt{UTILS} directory) on the SAC files to correct
the header variable NPTS to the actually written number of time steps.
The script must be called from the \texttt{SPECFEM3D} main directory,
and the input argument to this script is simply a list of SAC seismogram
files.


\section{Map Local Database}

A sample program \texttt{remap\_database} is provided to map the local
database from a set of machines to another set of machines. This is
especially useful when you want to run mesher and solver, or different
types of solvers separately through a scheduler (refer to Chapter~\ref{cha:Running-Scheduler}).

\begin{lyxcode}
run\_lsf.bash~-{}-gm-no-shmem~-{}-gm-copy-env~remap\_database

old\_machines~150~{[}old\_jobid~new\_jobid]
\end{lyxcode}

In order to keep the software package thread-safe in case a multithreaded
implementation of MPI is used, developers should not add modules or
common blocks to the source code but rather use regular subroutine
arguments (which can be grouped in ``derived types'' if needed for
clarity).

The Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre subroutines in \texttt{gll\_library.f90}
are based in part on software libraries from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA).

\chapter{\label{cha:Reference-Frame-Convention}Reference Frame Convention}

The code uses the following convention for the Cartesian reference frame:

\begin{itemize}
\item the $x$ axis points East
\item the $y$ axis points North
\item the $z$ axis points up
\end{itemize}
Note that this convention is different from both the \citet{AkRi80}
convention and the Harvard Centroid-Moment Tensor (CMT) convention.
The Aki \& Richards convention is

\begin{itemize}
\item the $x$ axis points North
\item the $y$ axis points East
\item the $z$ axis points down
\end{itemize}
and the Harvard CMT convention is

\begin{itemize}
\item the $x$ axis points South
\item the $y$ axis points East
\item the $z$ axis points up
\end{itemize}

\chapter{\label{cha:Non-Dimensionalization-Conventions}Non-Dimensionalization

we divide the parameters of the left column internally to perform the calculations.
The values output and saved by the code (seismograms, sensitivity kernels...) are then
scaled back to the right physical dimensions before being saved.

\chapter{Benchmarks}

\citet{KoTr02a,KoTr02b} carefully benchmarked the spectral-element
simulations of global seismic waves against normal-mode seismograms.
Version 4.0 of \texttt{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE} has been benchmarked again
following the same procedure.

In this appendix we present two tests: a `long-period' (periods longer
than 17~s) simulation of a shallow event in isotropic PREM \citep{DzAn81}
without the ocean layer, without attenuation but including the effects
of self-gravitation (in the Cowling approximation) (Figures \ref{fig:Vanuatu-with-Vertical}
and \ref{fig:Vanuatu-with-Transverse}), and a `short-period' (periods
longer than 9~s) simulation of a deep event in transversely isotropic
PREM without the ocean layer and including the effects of self-gravitation
and attenuation (Figures \ref{fig:Bolivia-with-Vertical}, \ref{fig:Bolivia-with-Transverse}
and \ref{fig:Bolivia-PKP}).

\end{figure}


The normal-mode synthetics are calculated with the code \texttt{QmXD}
using mode catalogs with a shortest period of 8~s generated by the
code \texttt{OBANI}. No free-air, tilt, or gravitational potential
corrections were applied \citep{DaTr98}. We also turned off the effect
of the oceans in \texttt{QmXD}.

The normal-mode and SEM displacement seismograms are first calculated
for a step source-time function, i.e., setting the parameter \texttt{half}
\texttt{duration} in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file to zero for the
SEM simulations. Both sets of seismograms are subsequently convolved
with a triangular source-time function using the processing script
\texttt{UTILS/seis\_}~\\
\texttt{process/process\_syn.pl}. They are also band-pass filtered
and the horizontal components are rotated to the radial and transverse
directions (with the script \texttt{UTILS/seis\_process/rotate.pl}).

The match between the normal-mode and SEM seismograms is quite remarkable
for the experiment with attenuation, considering the very different
implementations of attenuation in the two computations (e.g., frequency
domain versus time domain, constant Q versus absorption bands).

Further tests can be found in the \texttt{EXAMPLES} directory. It
contains the normal-mode and SEM seismograms, and the parameters (\texttt{STATIONS},
\texttt{CMTSOLUTION} and \texttt{Par\_file}) for the SEM simulations.

Important remark: when comparing SEM results to normal mode results, one needs to
convert source and receiver coordinates from geographic to geocentric coordinates,
because on the equator the geographic and
geocentric latitude are identical but not elsewhere. Even for
spherically-symmetric simulations one must perform this conversion
because the source and receiver locations provided by globalCMT.org and
IRIS involve geographic coordinates.

\chapter{\label{cha:SAC-headers}SAC Headers}

Information about the simulation (i.e., event/station information, sampling rate, etc.) is written in the header of the seismograms in SAC format. The list of values and related explanation are given in Figure \ref{fig:SAC-headers}. Please check the SAC webpages \urlwithparentheses{www.iris.edu/software/sac/} for further information. Please note that the reference time KZTIME is the centroid time ($t_\text{CMT}=t_\text{PDE}+\texttt{time shift}$) which corresponds to zero time in the synthetics. For kinematic rupture simulations, KZTIME is equal to the CMT time of the source having the minimum time-shift in the \texttt{CMTSOLUTION} file, and coordinates, depth and half-duration of the event are not provided in the headers.

\chapter{\label{cha:channel-codes}Channel Codes of Seismograms}

Seismic networks, such as the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), generally involve various types of instruments with different bandwidths, sampling properties and component configurations. There are standards to name channel codes depending on instrument properties. IRIS  \texttt{(www.iris.edu)} uses SEED/FDSN format for channel codes, which are represented by three letters, such as \texttt{LHN}, \texttt{BHZ}, etc. In older versions of the SPECFEM package, a common format was used for the channel codes of all seismograms, which was \texttt{LHE/LHN/LHZ} for three components. To avoid confusion when comparisons are made to observed data, we are now using the FDSN convention for SEM seismograms. In the following, we give a brief explanation of the FDSN convention and how it is adopted in SEM seismograms. Please visit \texttt{www.iris.edu/manuals/SEED\_appA.htm} for further information.\\

\noindent \textbf{\texttt{Band code:}} The first letter in the channel code denotes the band code of seismograms, which depends on the response band and the sampling rate of instruments. The list of band codes used by IRIS is shown in Figure \ref{fig:IRIS_band_codes}. The sampling rate of SEM synthetics is controlled by the resolution of simulations rather than instrument properties. However, for consistency, we follow the FDSN convention for SEM seismograms governed by their sampling rate. For SEM synthetics, we consider band codes for which $dt \leq 1$ s. The FDSN convention also considers the response band of instruments. For instance, short-period and broad-band seismograms with the same sampling rate correspond to different band codes, such as S and B, respectively. In such cases, we consider SEM seismograms as broad band, ignoring the corner period ($\geq 10$ s) of the response band of instruments (note that at these resolutions, the minimum period in the SEM synthetics will be less than $10$ s).
Accordingly, when you run a simulation the band code will be chosen depending on the resolution of the synthetics, and channel codes of SEM seismograms will start with either \texttt{L}, \texttt{M}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{H}, \texttt{C} or \texttt{F}, shown by red color in the figure.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/IRIS_band_codes.eps}\caption{\label{fig:IRIS_band_codes} The FDSN band code convention is based on the sampling rate and the response band of instruments. Please visit \texttt{www.iris.edu/manuals/SEED\_appA.htm} for further information. Grey rows show the relative band-code range in SPECFEM, and the band codes used to name SEM seismograms are denoted in red.}
\par\end{centering}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{\texttt{Instrument code:}} The second letter in the channel code corresponds to instrument codes, which specify the family to which the sensor belongs. For instance, \texttt{H} and \texttt{L} are used for high-gain and low-gain seismometers, respectively. The instrument code of SEM seismograms will always be \texttt{X}, as assigned by FDSN for synthetic seismograms. \\

\noindent \textbf{\texttt{Orientation code:}} The third letter in channel codes is an orientation code, which generally describes the physical configuration of the components of instrument packages. SPECFEM uses the traditional orientation code  \texttt{E/N/Z} (East-West, North-South, Vertical) for three components. \\

\noindent \textbf{\texttt{EXAMPLE:}} Depending on the resolution of your simulations, if the sampling rate is greater than $0.1$ s and less than $1$ s, a seismogram recorded on the vertical component of station \texttt{AAK} will be named \texttt{AAK.IU.MXZ.sem.sac}, whereas it will be \texttt{AAK.IU.BXZ.sem.sac}, if the sampling rate is greater than 0.0125 and less equal to 0.1 s.



\chapter{\label{cha:Troubleshooting}Troubleshooting}

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{description}
\item [configuration fails:]
   Examine the log file 'config.log'. It contains detailed informations.
   In many cases, the path's to these specific compiler commands F90,
   CC and MPIF90 won't be correct if `./configure` fails.

   Please make sure that you have a working installation of a Fortran compiler,
   a C compiler and an MPI implementation. You should be able to compile this
   little program code:
\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize      program main }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        include 'mpif.h' }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        integer, parameter :: CUSTOM\_MPI\_TYPE = MPI\_REAL }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        integer ier }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        call MPI\_INIT(ier) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        call MPI\_BARRIER(MPI\_COMM\_WORLD,ier) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize        call MPI\_FINALIZE(ier) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize      end}{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}


\item [compilation fails:] In case a compilation error like the following occurs, stating
\begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize    ...  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize    obj/meshfem3D.o: In function `MAIN\_\_':  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize    meshfem3D.f90:(.text+0x14): undefined reference to `\_gfortran\_set\_std'  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize    ...  }{\footnotesize \par}
\end{lyxcode}
  make sure you're pointing to the right 'mpif90' wrapper command.

  Normally, this message will appear when you are mixing two different Fortran
  compilers. That is, using e.g. gfortran to compile non-MPI files
  and mpif90, wrapper provided for e.g. ifort, to compile MPI-files.

  fix: e.g. specify > ./configure FC=gfortran MPIF90=/usr/local/openmpi-gfortran/bin/mpif90


\item [changing PPM model routines fails:]
  In case you want to modify the PPM-routines in file \texttt{model\_ppm.f90}, please consider the following points:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Please check in file \texttt{get\_model\_parameter.f90} that the entry for PPM models looks like:
  \begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize  ... }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  else if(MODEL\_ROOT == 'PPM') then  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   ! overimposed based on isotropic-prem  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   CASE\_3D = .true.  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   CRUSTAL = .true.  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   ISOTROPIC\_3D\_MANTLE = .true.  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   ONE\_CRUST = .true.  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   THREE\_D\_MODEL = THREE\_D\_MODEL\_PPM  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   TRANSVERSE\_ISOTROPY = .true. ! to use transverse-isotropic prem  }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  ...  }{\footnotesize \par}
  \end{lyxcode}
  You can set \texttt{TRANSVERSE\_ISOTROPY} to \texttt{.false.} in case you want to use the isotropic PREM
  as 1D background model.

  \item Transverse isotropy would mean different values for horizontal and vertically polarized wave speeds,
  i.e. different for vph and   vpv, vsh and vsv, and it includes an additional parameter eta.
  By default, we take these wave speeds from PREM and add your model perturbations to them.
  For the moment, your model perturbations are added as isotropic perturbations, using the same dvp for vph and vpv,
  and dvs for vsh   and vsv, see in \texttt{meshfem3D\_models.f90}:
  \begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize  ... }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize     case(THREE\_D\_MODEL\_PPM ) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       ! point profile model }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       call model\_PPM(r\_used,theta,phi,dvs,dvp,drho,PPM\_V) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       vpv=vpv*(1.0d0+dvp) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       vph=vph*(1.0d0+dvp) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       vsv=vsv*(1.0d0+dvs) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       vsh=vsh*(1.0d0+dvs) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize       rho=rho*(1.0d0+drho) }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize	... }{\footnotesize \par}
  \end{lyxcode}
 You could modify this to add different perturbations for vph and vpv, resp. vsh and vsv.
 This would basically mean that you add transverse isotropic perturbations.
 You can see how this is done with e.g. the model \texttt{s362ani},
 following the flag \texttt{THREE\_D\_MODEL\_S362ANI} on how to modify accordingly the file \texttt{meshfem3D\_models.f90}.

  \item In case you modify the structure \texttt{PPM\_V} in file \texttt{model\_ppm.f90},
  also check that in file \texttt{meshfem3D\_models.f90}, you use your updated \texttt{PPM\_V} structure (for example including dvp):
  \begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize  ... }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize! point profile model\_variables }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize type model\_ppm\_variables }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   sequence }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   double precision,dimension(:),pointer :: dvs,dvp,lat,lon,depth }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   double precision :: maxlat,maxlon,minlat,minlon,maxdepth,mindepth }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   double precision :: dlat,dlon,ddepth,max\_dvs,min\_dvs,max\_dvp,min\_dvp }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   integer :: num\_v,num\_latperlon,num\_lonperdepth }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize   integer :: dummy ! padding 4 bytes to align the structure }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize end type model\_ppm\_variables }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize type (model\_ppm\_variables) PPM\_V }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  ... }{\footnotesize \par}
  \end{lyxcode}

  Together with these modifications in file \texttt{meshfem3D\_models.f90}, your code should work fine.
  In case you want to add more specific model routines, follow the code sections starting with:
  \begin{lyxcode}
{\footnotesize  !--- }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  ! }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  ! ADD YOUR MODEL HERE }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  ! }{\footnotesize \par}
{\footnotesize  !--- }{\footnotesize \par}
  \end{lyxcode}
  to see code sections sensitive to model updates.

  \end{enumerate}

\item You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License.
\item If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
\end{enumerate}
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program,
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
under the scope of this License.

\item You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
\item Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of
the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,
\item Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
Subsection b above.)
\end{enumerate}
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
the source along with the object code.

\item You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
in full compliance.
\item You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
or works based on it.
\item Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
\item If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions
to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance
on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

\item If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as
if written in the body of this License.
\item The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.


Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
``any later version,'' you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

\item If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{NO WARRANTY }

\begin{itemize}

\item[11.]BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

\item[12.]IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs}

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make
it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
For example:

\begin{quote}
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright {\footnotesize $\copyright$ (}year) (name of author)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
\end{quote}
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

\begin{quote}
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright $\copyright$ year name of author Gnomovision
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This
is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type `show c' for details.
\end{quote}
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use
may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could
even be mouse-clicks or menu items -- whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program,
if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

\begin{quote}
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

(signature of Ty Coon)\\
1 April 1989 \\
Ty Coon, President of Vice
\end{quote}
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.
