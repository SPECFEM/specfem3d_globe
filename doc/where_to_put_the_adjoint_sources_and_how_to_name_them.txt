For adjoint runs (SIMULATION_TYPE = 3), the adjoint sources need to be put in the "SEM" sub-directory in the root directory of the code.

If your adjoint source have names of the following form for instance:

STA00.NET.MXZ.sem.ascii.adj
STA00.NET.MXZ.sem.ascii.adj

you will need to rename them to:

STA00.NET.MXZ.adj
STA00.NET.MXZ.adj

i.e. suppress ".sem.ascii".

You will also need to create a file called STATIONS_ADJOINT in the "DATA" directory in the root directory of the code. That file can be identical to the DATA/STATIONS file if you had a single station in STATIONS.
