Introduction

Auxiliary material contains two tables and one figure.

1. 2007gl032244-ds01.txt
Dataset 1 contains the data in digital form of the crustal model EuCRUST-07 
presented in the paper. 

Available results of deep seismic reflection, refraction and receiver 
functions studies are assembled in this integrated model at a uniform grid (15’x15’). 
The study area is limited to 35N-71N, 25W-35E.
The model consists of three layers: sediments and two layers of the crystalline crust. 
The table provides the depth to the crustal boundaries (in km), average 
P-wave velocities in the upper and lower parts of the crystalline crust 
and weight average of the entire crystalline crust (in km/s). 
A velocity structure of the sediments is not specified. 
This grid was obtained using using a standard kriging method (SURFER, 
Golden Software package), see text for further explanation.

The first two columns of the table contain the geographical coordinates 
of the data: X, Longitude (deg); Y, Latitude (deg); 
The third, fourth and fifth columns contain the velocity in the crystalline 
crust. Abbreviations are as follow:
UC, average P-wave velocity in the upper crust (km/s); LC, average P-wave 
velocity in the lower crust (km/s); AvCrust, average P-wave velocity in the crust (km/s); 
The sixth, seventh and eighth columns contain the depth to the crustal 
boundaries. Abbreviations are as follow:
Topo, Topography (ETOPO2)(km)*; Basement, depth of the basement (km)**; 
UC/LC,depth of the upper/lower crust discontinuity(km); Moho, Moho depth(km). 
*Negative values are below the sea level. **Negative values are above the sea level.

Table S1 contains a source of information about European crustal structure 
from seismic studies. These information colected by the literature available 
were used to construct EuCRUST-07 model. 

The first column of the table labelled as 'Area' describes the geographical 
location of the seismic data. 
The second column of the table labelled as 'Method' describes the method 
used in the seismic studies to acquire the data.
The third column of the table labelled as 'Source' contains the reference 
number of the seismic studies.The reference list follows this table.
The fourth column of the table describes the kind of information (about 
crustal structure and/or Moho depth) acquired from the seismic studies

Abbreviations in Table S1 are as follow: S. Refr., Seismic refraction; 
S. Refl., Seismic reflection; RF, receiver function analysis; 
C, information about crustal structure, M, information about Moho depth.

Figure S1 describes the depth to basement determined using different 
sedimentary thickness/depth of the basement compilations.
The red lines depict the limits of each compilation used. In the area 
outside the red boundaries the sedimentary thickness map of EXXON [1985] is employed.
Numbers over the map stand for the sources used in the compilation of this map:

All the compilations are verified and some of them (1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9) are 
modified in several areas according to the seismic profiles used (Table 1) 
in order to trace the top of the crystalline crust.
Concerning the continental domain, sediments and soft crust (e.g. in the Appennines) 
having average P-wave velocity lower than 6 km/s, are included in the sedimentary layer. 
Few exceptions are represented by the Polish Trough, where the metamorphic 
sediments/volcanic strata layer (referred in Grad et al., 2005 as a 'transition zone'), 
having Vp < 6.0 km/s are included in the upper crust and the Adriatic Sea, 
where only the sediments having average velocity less than 5 km/s are included 
in the sedimentary layer. 
Concerning the oceanic domain, fractured basaltic lavas having average 
P-wave velocity lower than 5 km/s are included in the sedimentary layer. 
The integration of the separate compilations in a unique map (15'x15') 
was done using the same method employed to trace the Moho boundary 
(see text for further explanations).
