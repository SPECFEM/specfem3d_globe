I have several files on "pangu", please copy:

run_lsf
go_mesher_solver_lsf_globe.bash

to your global code directory,
and type 'run_lsf' to start your run, the only
thing you may want to modify is the last line
of 'run_lsf', where -W option specifies the
estimated run time, (you may want to over-estimate
it so that your job won't get terminated when the
time is up, I know right now you can get away
with no -W option, but David may enforce that
in the future)

to collect seismograms, use:

collect_seismo.pl OUTPUT_FILES/machines

to clean the database:

cleanbase.pl OUTPUT_FILES/machines
