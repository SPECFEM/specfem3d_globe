To-do list for SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, updated on January 11, 2007:
------------------------------------------------------------

Dimitri Komatitsch and David Michea
-----------------------------------

- supprimer NER_BOTTOMDBL_TOPDBL de constants.h (c'est un detail qui prend 5 minutes, Dimitri le fera demain)

- carefully study and improve stability condition and increase/adapt time step DT accordingly

- dire a Brian Savage (Washington D.C.) de faire un auto_NER a partir de PREM (choix automatique des parametres) a partir de display_prem_sampling_doubling.f90 dans DATA/util/mesh_doubling_superbrick

- use indirect addressing to store anisotropy in the mantle to avoid having to
  start with that region, which breaks the Cuthill-McKee sorting; once this is
  done, suppress the statement in which we make this region become region number 1
  in the mesh creation routine

- merge the mesher in the solver, suppress storage of large mesh files on
  local disks, but make sure we keep the creation of AVS/OpenDX mesh files
  (which should be the case since we use specific routines called write_AVS_DX_*.f90)

- implement better (partly inflated) central cube

- split central cube in 2 with MPI to have better load balancing there

- rewrite communications entirely (use clean non-blocking MPI communications, hide communications
  in calculations); see how to do this in the central cube, which is more
  difficult because it is in contact with many slices

- use persistent communications

- implement classical Cuthill-McKee sorting

- develop two-level Cuthill-McKee sorting for the two levels of cache with Jose Maria Cela (Barcelona)

- maybe use VMX/Altivec instructions in compute_forces*.f90 specifically for
  MareNostrum with Jose Maria Cela (Barcelona)

- run Sdiff calculations for Lev Vinnik (Moscow, Russia)

- run 3D PKP calculations for Sebastien Chevrot (Toulouse, France)
