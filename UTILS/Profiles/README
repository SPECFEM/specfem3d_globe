write_profile.f90:

This program writes profiles of material properties for the model chosen in Par_file.  It was written for revision r12386 and was found to work for some models.  It will most likely not work with other revisions, but can be used as a template for creating a new program.

To update the program:
First models that have been recently added need to be read at the top, and the appropriate variables need to be declared.  Most of the
code is from get_model.f90 and is marked with comments.  Copy paste the corresponding part from the most recent get_model.f90 and paste it
into write_profile.f90.  Updated calls to subroutines may be necessary, in particular to read_compute_parameters which often changes.  Copy write_profile.f90 to the trunk directory.  Add the following lines to the Makefile:

write_profile: $O/write_profile.o $O/exit_mpi.o $(LIBSPECFEM)
	${MPIFCCOMPILE_CHECK} -o xwrite_profile $O/exit_mpi.o $O/write_profile.o $(LIBSPECFEM) $(MPILIBS)

$O/write_profile.o: constants.h write_profile.f90
	${MPIFCCOMPILE_CHECK} -c -o $O/write_profile.o ${FCFLAGS_f90} write_profile.f90

Then execute:
make write_profile
./xwrite_profile

The code should write profiles every 2x2 degrees for the entire globe.
