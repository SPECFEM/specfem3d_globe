mesh2vtu/ -- it requires the installation of vtk package. 
             once vtk is installed, you can set the vars 
             in the Makefile and compile all the programs

How to collect and visualize 3D/2D data generated by the parallel simulation?

0. run global_slice_number(2).pl to figure out the slices you need to collect
1. copy database using the corresponding scripts in collect_database/
2. combine all the databases using the program combine_vol_data.f90 or combine_surf_data.f90
3. convert the mesh file to vtu file using mesh2vtu/
4. visualizing in Paraview. After loading in the .vtu file, you can generate the source-
receiver cross-section using the normals given by global_slice_number.pl

Yes, it is a pretty painful process. You can certainly streamline them using a master bash
script. To make life easier, you can use VTK scripts instead of Paraview in step 4.

Good luck!
