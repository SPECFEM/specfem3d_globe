I have several files on "pangu", please copy:

run_lsf
go_mesher_solver_lsf_globe.bash

to your global code directory,
and type 'run_lsf' to start your run, the only
thing you may want to modify is the last line
of 'run_lsf', where -W option specifies the
estimated run time, (you may want to over-estimate
it so that your job won't get terminated when the
time is up, I know right now you can get away
with no -W option, but David may enforce that
in the future)

The 'machines' file is created by the go_mesher_solver_globe.bash
script from the LSF scheduler machine list in OUTPUT_FILES/lsf_machines,
and it is in the same format as the mymachines file we used
on hrothgar (one node per line). If you run your job on Pangu
through the scheduler, the machines are assigned to you and I do not think
you can specify the machines file like we did on hrothgar. 

to collect seismograms, use:

collect_seismo.pl OUTPUT_FILES/machines

to clean the database:

cleanbase.pl OUTPUT_FILES/machines
