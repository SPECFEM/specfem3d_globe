# the stations file needs to be updated at least once six months:
# and here is how **** 
#
# first download all LH station info from
# http://www.iris.edu/SeismiQuery/channel.htm
# check on network, station, channel (LH_), start time(1000/1/1), end time, 
# elevation, depth, latitude and longitude (up right corner above the map).
# and ask it to be delivered to your email address.
#
# Get rid of the headers and save it as a text file: lh.txt
# lh.txt -> lh2.txt
# count the line where all temporary networks starts: ^X
sort -k 1 lh.txt | awk 'NR <= 20969 {print $0}' | awk '{print $1,$2}' | uniq> lh2.txt

# then use python script
find_sta.py > STATIONS_LH

# delete repeating lines
awk '{print $1,$2}' STATIONS_LH | sort -k 1 > t1.txt
uniq t1.txt > t2.txt
diff t1.txt t2.txt
# and hand-delete repeating lines (I'll script it in the future)

# find II/IU stations only
awk '$2=="II" || $2=="IU" {print $0}' STATIONS_LH > STATIONS_LH_II_IU 

# to get corresponding station naming information
# http://www.iris.edu/SeismiQuery/station.htm
# use the following permanent networks:
# AD AF AZ BE BK CI CN CU DK G GD G GD GE G GE G GT G HT HW IC II IM IU KN LB LD L I MN MS MY NM NN NR NZ OE OV PB PI PM PS SF TA TS TW US UW
# and select network station, lat,lon
# Delete the headers (grep -v NETWORK) from the output and save as a text file station_info.txt
# select the lines corresponding to our lh stations by sta_info.py --> stations_info_lh.txt
#
#
# at the end of all operations, cp STATIONS_II_IU to DATA/STATIONS and STATIONS_LH to STATIONS_LH_TIMESTAMP
