<h1>OUTPUT FORMAT</h1>

<b>RECORD LENGTH</b>:  The desired record length of the synthetic seismograms (in minutes).  This controls the length of the numerical simulation, i.e., twice the record length requires twice as much CPU time.<br><br>

<b>RECEIVERS AT DEPTH</b>: Turn this option on to accommodate stations with instruments that are buried, i.e., the solver will calculate seismograms at the burial depth specifed in the STATIONS file. <br><br>
